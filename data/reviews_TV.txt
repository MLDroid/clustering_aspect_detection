review_title: 5-star TV, 5-star purchase, 5-star delivery
review_text: Samsung HLT5687SAX 56-inch Slim LED Engine 1080p DLP HDTV-Purchased the end of Feb 2008.-TV has worked flawlessly. We love the picture quality. Easily viewable from greater angles than I expected. Picture is not washed out by lots of sunlight.-Delivery guy was great. He called to set up appointment to deliver, calling me again before arriving to give me time to get home. After bringing it in and setting it up, he helped us connect it to our other components. (I think it was delivered by Eagle Trucking.)-Purchase experience from Amazon couldn't possibly have gone better. I was unable to follow the tracking info for the trucking company. Emailed Amazon about it and had personal and immediate attention to help me figure out the delivery situation. There were 2 price drops during my 30-day "grace period" which I emailed Amazon about. Had a refund of the drop amount and an email informing me within a day.One of the best all-around buying experiences I've ever had!

review_title: Stunning Picture Quality
review_text: Amazing Clarity. Awesome, accurate color. This Plasma display is even better at home connected to Dish Network HD box (saw it at 1st at Circuit City/Costco/Sams Club). The HD channels had my wife and me entranced until it was WAY past our usual bedtime. Now let me tell, we were watching without any of the color tweaking recommended by an independent review site (DTV, I believe). We were simply too busy counting zits and hair follicles on the announcers heads. Even the standard def channels looked better than my prior TV (RCA 50" inch DLP, ~3 years old). I used my old $50 DVI cable (a generic internet brand from Ram electronics)hooked up to a DVI-to-HDMI converter. No need for those over $100 expensive brand names. The sound quality was also quite good (again better than my old set). The remote has large numbered buttons and easy navigation. I haven't coded the other remotes in yet so I can't comment on htat aspect. One site did comment on power consumption (quite high compared to other plasmas), but if you see the picture you might well conclude it is worth it. Tonight, I'm watching the Lakers and a movie (these and sports/golf are my 2 main TV activities), so I'll update on DVD picture quality later. I'm giving it 4 stars (just wanted to be honest) because I haven't set up the universal remote feature and the DVD picture, but up to this point I'm really happy with my purchase!

review_text: I purchased my unit shorly after the first of the year. I have my computer (via the DVI), as well as direct cable, my HDTV cable box, my VCR and my DVD all connected simultaneously. Am very pleased with the performance regardless of which device I am using. The HDTV is simply stunning. The only drawback I can think of is that I can't have progressive DVD input if I have HDTV as well. Although small price to pay for a device that does so much.Cheers.

review_title: pleased for the price
review_text: [...]I took advice from reviews here and must say after a couple hours of setup and tweaking, I am pleased. I wanted a second PC monitor for gaming. I currently have a 19" trinitron and this may not be as sharp, but really looks great. For the price, having a 27 inch gaming screen is sweet. The games look really nice and response time is fast. I then setup the S cable for cable and routed the audio in as well. Once I fixed the resolution on the PC, it actually is a better PC monitor then TV I think. Hint, set your computer resolution to 1280x 720. This seems to be the best. Anything other and my text/fonts looked unreadable. I was close to frustrated and figured this out and it rocks. I wish the TV resolution was as nice. Still seems grainy Maybe it is my cable provider too. I was able to keep my other TV connected to the cable box via the coax connection and using the svideo for my new tv. Side by side, I don't see much difference between a 10 year old toshiba and this new LCD. I do enjoy the PIP though while working on the PC and watching TV on the side. :) Very trick option. Even though the speakers are not earth shattering, they are loud enough for a bed room TV. Lots of connection options with this TV. Not bad for the 800-900 range.Hope this helps. So far, very pleasedChuck

review_title: Limited blacks, and some motion blurr/digitization
review_text: I bought this TV because it was a Consumer Reports Best Buy. Overall, it is acceptable, but I am very concerned with the limited number of apps available, the digitization of the picture on occasion, the motion blur and the poorly designed button placement on the remote. The picture quality is good, but does not have the deep blacks that makes that extra difference.

review_title: READ BEFORE BUYING THIS T.V.
review_text: DO NOT BUY THIS T.V! Purchased the samsung dlp tv in 2008 and within two and a half years the tv began to have white dots that completely covered the tv screen and shortly after that black dots began to pop up all over the screen as well. I found that it was a samsung manufactures mistake. After calling samsung and getting the run around, they said that my tv was not one they would fix for free.Sad that a billion dollar company would not take care of their customers do to their mistake. They transfered me to there repair department only to find that they do not repair dlp tv's anymore!! Yes you read right, THEY DONT REPAIR TV'S THAT THEY SOLD ME A COUPLE OF YEARS earlier!I called a local tv repair service to see what could be done. It came down to me having to pay $500.00 to get it fixed! Wow, I payed over $2,000 for a tv that only worked for less than four years.Samsung DLP tv's are horrible. Dont waste your money.

review_title: Very pleased
review_text: At first I was a bit concerned about buying this Samsung HLT5087S 50" slim LED engine 1080p DLP HDTV online without getting a chance to see how it actually looked in person, but I decided to buy it anyway. Well, I couldn't be more pleased. Very beautiful on or off. The HD is incredible. I've heard some say that the sound is not all that great. Well, I dissagree. The sound is good quality. So even if you don't have a surround sound system you won't be dissapointed in what this set gives you with its true surround sound. I've had the set about a week now and everthing is great. If you have any concerns about the delivery put that to rest as well. The delivery was excellent.Like all electronics this will probably be a dinasour in about a year but remember this is 1080P so you will be ahead of the curve (for awhile anyway). And as someone once told me "If you find something you like and it works the way you would like it to, get it a be done with it." I like what I have very much and I am done. I trust that you will have as good of an experience.

review_title: Great TV, Great Price!
review_text: I've had my TV for about two months now and I have no complaints. I was a little skeptical about ordering such an expensive piece of equipment through the mail, but with the Amazon price being so much lower than the big box stores and having heard testimonials from others, I decided to chance it. Not only did the TV arrive in one piece with no defects, it arrived a week sooner than anticipated. The shipping company even called me at work to schedule all the details of the delivery! On to the TV itself. I did quite a bit of research before purchasing the Samsung LNS3251D, including stops at several stores to compare the various models. I also spent many hours reading reviews on the Web. There are LCDs that are much cheaper (and few that are more expensive), but I was immediately drawn to the Samsung because of its overall aesthetics. Yes, the picture quality was great, but let's be honest: to a casual observer like me, there's not really a noticeable difference between the Samsung and its higher-end competitors (e.g. Sony). For someone coming from a lifetime of standard def, they all looked amazing. So you really have to make your decision on the way the TV makes you feel. Remember, your new TV is going to sit (or hang) in your living room or bedroom for many years to come. You wouldn't want to buy an expensive painting and then hang it in a cheap frame, would you? The Samsung was by far the most visually appealing to my eyes. I currently have mine on a TV stand, but it would look equally good mounted on the wall. It really is like a work of art. Now, I don't play video games and I am not a huge movie buff, so I'll leave the discussion of the pros and cons of the Samsung's features in that regard to the other reviewers. I bought my TV primarily for watching sports, and I have not been disappointed (football, baseball, golf, basketball, hockey -- they're all amazing to watch in high def). Some of the night games look a little dark and grainy on the TV, but if you play around with the brightness feature on the remote you can usually make it look pretty good. There is no ghost effect. The sound is nothing special but perfectly adequate for my needs. As others have noted, the TV takes a few seconds to turn off an on, but that's such a minor annoyance its almost not even worth mentioning. So, if you're in the market for a mid-sized LCD, I would highly recommend this model.

review_title: NICE!!!!
review_text: This is a really nice TV. I did a lot of research before purchasing this TV. The fact that the LED DLP lasts the life of the TV is what did it for me, since I was planning on buying a Samsung DLP anyway. Before purchasing this set I saw that there was also an HLT5089S that was very similar. After visiting the Samsung website I still couldn't figure out what the difference was between the 87S and 89S model, so I called Samsung. They said the only difference is that the 89S model has Bluetooth capability, which isn't something I need. I currently have a cable box/DVR, XBOX 360, and the Pioneer XBOX 360 sound system hooked up to it. The Game Mode on this set looks really nice. One of my favorite shows is Planet Earth and that just looks sick as hell in HD on this set. The sound on the TV is ok, but I would recommend hooking up a sound system. After my purchase I registered this product on the Samsung website and they gave me 3 more months of warranty coverage for free. I also purchased the matching stand which was fairly easy to set up.

review_title: Ahead of its time!!!
review_text: I did painstaking research for months to find the right tv for our living room. I had narrowed it down to this one and a Toshiba in the same size. I liked this one due to the 4000:1 contrast and its sleek design. The picture quality of this tv is amazing, let me say that again... amazing. The HD channels that I receive is truly sharp and crystal clear. But and I do mean but this tv is ahead of its time. Congress passed a new law that all television programing must be digital by February 2009. Currently the majority of tv is viewed in an analog signal. So on a tv that is so sharp and so crystal clear it actually makes the picture of an analog signal seem at times blurry or less than even a tube tv. This is due to the signal attempting to upconvert to the performance of the tv. This is regardless of how it is hooked up. I use the composite, component and the S-video and it seems like the S-video at this time is better. That of course will change when all programming is digitalized. It is like taking a digital photo with a 2 MP camera and then trying to enlarge the image on your computer, it can become a bit distorted but then taking that same image with a 10 MP camera the image is much clearer, much sharper and all around a better quality. That is what will happen when all programming is made digital. This will occur slowly over the next two years but it will happen. Watching a dvd is amazing on this tv, watching HD is amazing on this tv, watching other channels not so good but that is going to be for any tv that has such a high contrast and the price is great as well. I bought this for just under $1100 and then noticed that it was even cheaper now, after calling amazon they credited me the difference so everybody won. This shipping arrived much faster than the website stated. In fact an entire week earlier. Would definately buy from Amazon again and have no worries with using Eagle shipping. This tv is the best product in the 32 inch class and has one of the best price points. You will not be disappointed I know that I am not.

review_title: A great HDTV
review_text: I bought this TV in January 2007 and I love it. The picture is phenomenal. A friend of mine bought the smaller version of this set and loves it too.At this point in time (late Nov 2007), though, the newer models are out and so this one is likely outdated or will be discontinued soon. But if you can get one for a solid discount off the new models (say $1500?) you wouldn't be unhappy.And as many others have written, set the Picture Mode to something other than Vivid for a more natural, pleasing view.

Even SD feeds look good, surprisingly.The interface on the menu is very intuitive, and therefore easy to use. The range of adjustable settings is unprecedented.I can't rate the speakers, as I don't use them and have an actual receiver.

review_title: great tv but dead pixel problems from day 1
review_text: well not from day one more like day 15 since I've had the tv, at first I thought it was a bad connection but then I called up samsung and its a dead pixel problem. the tv turns red and the pixels move with the tv no joke, I have pictures to prove it and will post a video on youtube if I can. Then it fixes itself and looks as if it never happened, well luckily its still under warranty and hopefully it can be fixed and never happen again, but anyway back to the tv. 360 looks amazing on this tv, regular xbox looks just ok. as for pc hook up its ok as well, the text is really small but playing videos from your computer looks really good and its not bad as a computer monitor. There are 3 things I don't like about the tv, the remote the glossy finish, and it takes awhile to turn on. The glossy finish does look classy but it scratches really easily and I don't like that I like my tv looking new you can't see them far away but when you look at it up close its very noticeable. Yes and the sound and remote is week but not horrible as some people say I actually don't mind the remote. If you're looking for quality go with this tv if you're looking for reliability buy it at a store and not online.

review_title: Great HDTV!!
review_text: This is my first HDTV and I did a lot of research before deciding on theSamsung 32" LCD. The online reviews were favorable but I went to a localvideo store and compared the Samsung with other, more expensive, brandsand, to my untrianed eye, it was the clear winner, especially considering the price.Amazon delivered on time, with no damage to the box. Setup was prettystaightforward after I acquired an HD converter from my cable provider.I had it all ready just in time for the bowl games. What a picture! Highlyrecommended!

review_title: Excellent and absolutely stunning TV
review_text: I bought this TV in early November and thought it would be a good idea to try out this set for a couple months before posting my thoughts on it. I will try to be as brief as possible and separate this review into pros and cons.Pros: Cosmetically, this TV is super sexy. The glossy piano bezel black looks very nice, hidden speakers, and the glowing Samsung jewel just looks cool. I also like the thin frame around the display very much. Picture quality is outstanding and the colors really jump out at you, especially on the default "Dynamic" picture mode setting. Plenty of inputs -- the 3 HDMI inputs is a definite plus. All of my video game systems work fantastic on this display. The Wii, GameCube, PS2, and N64 all look and play great. I sit about 10 feet away from this TV for both playing games and watching TV/movies. I also hook up my laptop to this TV via the VGA in (outputting my laptop at 1920x1080 resolution) and it works perfectly.Cons: There is a noticable "blue halo effect" (also known as the "smudge effect" or "hot spots"), but it does not really bother me enough to go to the effort of getting it replaced. Samsung will fix this for free under your one year warranty period if you so desire. There is also a slight rainbow effect. Both the halo effect and rainbow effect are only noticeable in dark scenes. Finally, there are some uniformity issues. Certain parts of the screen seem to be darker or brighter depending on where your eyes are looking directly across from if you are standing close to the TV, but it is not a big deal if you view the TV from a standard viewing distance (7 to 12 feet away).This TV matches perfectly with the stand from Pinnacle Design that is made for Samsung DLP TVs. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase and if I could do it over again, I probably would have bought the 61" version for only $200-300 more (definitely worth it).Edit: I just wanted to update this review with one piece of information I forgot to include the first time around - shipping. I ordered the TV on a Thursday and it was all setup and sitting on my living room by Tuesday at noon. Amazon used a carrier called Eagle Delivery to deliver my TV. The TV came a week sooner than the expected delivery date shown on my Amazon online invoice. Eagle gave me a call the night before my TV was to be delivered, so I was pleasantly surprised when I received the phone call. They setup a time with me for the delivery and when the delivery man came, he called my cell phone and was in and out of my home with no problems. He unpacked the TV and turned it on to make sure it was working. He also offered to take all the packaging away for me. So all in all, I was very pleased with the service from Eagle and the ease of ordering my TV through Amazon. For all of you who are hesitant about buying things online, especially something as big and expensive as this TV, don't be. Amazon and Eagle did a great job and they exceeded my expectations. It was actually more convenient to order this TV online since the TV was literally moved into and setup in my living room for me!

review_text: As I'm sure like a lot of you this is the most expensive TV that I have ever bought. I spent a long time researching and reading about large screen TV's. At first I was leaning towards a Plasma but was worried about burn in so I decided on a DLP, and with the LED and no color wheel to break down or make noise this set was for me. Also Consumer Reports had much good to say about this set.I recommended that you make sure that it is bought and ships from Amazon as that will eliminate any problems like other have had if you read the other reviews. When I ordered this set it was $1408 and dropped to $1179.99 the next week! No problem, one call to Amazon and they credited my card with the difference. They are the best! I put my order in on Saturday and it arrived the next Friday 5 days before Eagle's estimated delivery date. They called the day before as promised and it arrived on time. I was brought in and un packed and checked out including operation and hook up.The set is everything I had hoped for and more. HD picture is amazing and the Digital channels on my cable are nearly as good. Set up is fairly easy although I am still learning all the functions and controls. Overall an awesome set and value!!I'm am very satisfied. THANKS AMAZON!!

review_title: Great TV, with some minor quality issues
review_text: I purchased this unit via Warehouse Deals, (Amazon subsidiary). It arrived in exactly the condition described, and even has the full factory warranty (refurbished unit). The deal was exceptional, (under $1100), and having the Amazon 30 day return policy in place really made me feel comfortable with the purchase.Eagle was great for shipping/tracking, although they only sent one guy to deliver the TV. He was pleasant, and the white glove service proceeded exactly as described, (other than my helping him move the box...rather than have him muscle it onto a dolly and into the house himself). There was absolutely no rush. He helped me put the TV on the stand and patiently waited while I powered it up and made cable connections to ensure that it was functioning properly.Amazon was somewhat poor re communication. At the time of purchase an Amazon rep (via phone) couldn't really give me the specifics about the TV, i.e. condition, warranty, if shipping was "white glove". They also failed to respond to a later email query relative to those same issues.On to the TV. WOW!! Just an amazing picture. HD material is truly breathtaking. On rare instances the TV does display the Blue halo/Blue smudge issue that Samsung has already noted as a common defect. The repair of the issue is about a 15 minute job and covered under warranty. I highly recommend that anyone thinking of purchasing one of these take a peek through the AVSForum site. There is a lot of information available about these sets.Non HD feed material is OK. It really suffers when expanded out to 56". If it is a digital feed the picture is still quite good. If it is an analog station converted to digital via cable box, then the picture really suffers (first 100 channels of Comcast lineup in my area).Connected cable and up-converting DVD player via HDMI with absolutely no problems.Sound is fine for normal viewing, but nothing dramatic. If you want a really immersive movie experience, then you have to route sound through an appropriate surround system.The LED/DLP setup allows for very fast power-up. Excellent brightness. And the lack of concern re having to replace a bulb every 2 - 4 years. The set is absolutely fine for full daylight viewing, (my living room has numerous windows) and in fact can be too bright (will bother my eyes) in Dynamic and/or standard modes.There have been a lot of complaints in professional reviews of this set relative to blacks not being deep enough. I'm not a technician, or in any way an expert, but I'm very happy with the black level. Once again...the picture is amazing. You truly can't appreciate how nice it is when viewing the set in a store with out of the box settings and bright fluorescent lighting.Once the set was adjusted per CNET and/or other professional calibration website suggestions the picture was just incredible. Absolutely NO regrets going with this set over the Sony 3000 series.

review_title: Great Refurb TV, Great Shipping.
review_text: I've had this TV for over a month now and i love it. I have been using the PS3 and Xbox 360 with HDMI and the games look great. Comcast cable HDMI box. Everything looks great. I have had no problems with the TV, being a refurb i was worried. The description said minor damage on TV and Accessory. There wasnt a scratch on either, and it came with everything it was supposed to. When i ordered it WarehouseDeals didnt actually have the TV yet. They got it to Eagle/CEVA about 4 days after I ordered it. CEVA got it to me 2 days later. As soon as the CEVA tracking hit my state i called them and set up a delivery for the next day. They called back at the end of the day and had a driver that lived by me that wanted to bring me the TV that day, bonus!! Picture is great on HD channels, and pretty good on regular channels, though you can definitely tell the difference.

review_title: Quite a deal
review_text: This tv only cost $1800 and with free shipping from Amazon. The Eagle delivery service arrived only a couple days after it was shipped and took it out of the box and set it on my stand. The only problem I had was a piece of dust on one of the lenses or something which was causing a black mark to appear on the screen. It was easily noticeable so I tried replacing it with Amazon. Amazon directed me to Samsung's warranty service and Samsung then directed me to a shop capable of in-house servicing. The shop told me they couldn't fix my problem and told me to get a replacement from Amazon _. After contacting Amazon 3 times to replace it I didn't get any response from them for the next 3 days. Luckily, the piece of dust fell off so my screen looks how it should've in the first place. I'd just like to say I was a bit disappointed in Amazon's customer service. The tv itself is fantastic so it's getting 5 stars from me.

review_title: Product Quality
review_text: Beautiful picture with excellent color and contrast. NO GLARE what-so-ever.We are very impressed with this product.Note* for the new LCD TV buyer there is a slightly longer delay after pressing the remote, this is the case with all LCD TV's.Product is excellent, however, the delivery company was not that great. I took off a half day of work but they did not show up until 7 pm. Very frustrating.

review_title: Great DLP Television
review_text: This television lives up to the hype and great reviews it receives on all sites.It delivers a great, crisp picture; has good sound (although with a TV this size, you would almost definately use some sort of home theater system); and looks amazing with its piano black finish.My set had some dust trapped inside that was clinging to the inside of the screen. A call to Amazon and Samsung resulted in a Samsung tech out the next day to remove the dust. While it would have been great to not need a service call so soon, it went smoothly. No complaints.Kudos to Amazon for an amazing price, fantastic service, and teaming up with a great shipping company.Eagle (Ceva) Logistics took the television out of the box, brought it up a flight of stairs, put it on my stand, and made sure it worked.I am very happy so far, and expect to remain so for some time.I purchased the television with a Platinum Mastercard, which extends the MFR warranty an additional year, in the event anything goes wrong in year 2 of ownership. Something to think about if you have such a card. (I believe Visa and Amex have similar warranty extensions as well for some of their cards).Thank you, thank you, thank you Samsung for a great TV, and Amazon for the best price out there.

review_title: Quite a surprise!
review_text: Considering the the pros and cons of the various formats, decided upon the DLP and LED light engine. A little concerned that the brightness may not be what I would expect. I am pleasantly suprised at the brightness and color clarity. The internal tuner quickly picked up the OTA signals with a RadioShack antenna and descrambled many HD signals from the basic cable connection. I am using the standard cable connnections and S-video inputs....I am extremely pleased with the selection, service and delivery I received from AMAZON. Quite amazing!

review_title: Phenomenal HDTV
review_text: I've had this television for approximately two weeks now and I couldn't be happier. The HD picture is simply stunning, with very realistic colors and good black rendering (which can be a weak spot for some plasma sets). I also have a Sony upconverting DVD player that looks extraordinarily good on the Panasonic, although not as good as a genuine HD signal. If you have a large DVD collection that you'd rather not replace, I would recommend investing in an upconverting DVD player. They're pretty cheap - I got mine for $71 plus shipping on the Amazon marketplace. Be sure to connect the DVD player to the TV with an HDMI cable to receive the full benefits of upconversion.For optimal picture quality, use an HDMI cable to connect your cable box to the TV. My Comcast cable box does not have an HDMI output, but it does have a DVI output, and you can get a DVI to HDMI cable to send a digital signal to the TV (as opposed to the analog component cables that the cable box came with). If you have to use a DVI output, note that DVI outputs can't handle sound, so you'll need to run an optical cable to your home theater or the component cables to the TV in order to get sound.Also, like most HDTVs, the Panasonic's default picture settings are extremely bright. This is great for getting your attention in the store but is not particularly realistic. The Plasma TV Buying Guide used a colorimeter to determine the optimal settings for the picture. They are as follows:Picture Mode: StandardPicture: +22Brightness: +8Color: -1Tint: -4Sharpness: -14Color Temperature: WarmEnhanced Black Level: OffUsing these settings will give you a far more realistic picture than the artificially bright default settings.The bottom line: Get this TV, make sure you hook it up properly, always using HDMI cables (or DVI to HDMI cables if your cable box doesn't have an HDMI output) and optical cables for optimal picture and sound. Then adjust your picture settings to the ones the Plasma TV Buying Guide recommends. You'll be absolutely thrilled with the results.The TH-50PX60U receives my very highest recommendation.

review_title: Great HDTV and best deal for it is on Amazon!
review_text: I've owned this set for about 3 weeks now and it is incredible. I thought I would hire Firedog for $99 to do the calibration, etc. but then I said I would see how it looks first - it is awesome right out of the box! You MUST use hdmi cable for the absolute best picture and sound. Oh, and I bought $5 hdmi cables right from an Amazon supplier and they are just fine. The sound is much better than everyone says when you use hdmi.On this big set sports are incredible, you feel like you are out there with them, lol. The remote is easy to work with and you can change screen size with one button. The regular channels have a gray bar on the sides which is lousy but when you change the screen size to 'wide-screen-fit' it looks decent.The hdtv channels are where the fun is, the travel channel, sports, music is just terrific. I'm sure my cable co will keep adding stations and I can't wait for more!

review_title: Perfect Smart TV
review_text: We have only had our new smart tv for two months now, but so far we love it! It has so many ways to be personalized all of which are very easy to do. I love the content available, but wish Samsung would make them a bit less expensive. We already had to purchase the pricey television, which was well worth the price though. The only problem I have had is programing the cable remote to the television. I have tried everything that has been suggested by the television and the cable company, but with no success. I guess I will have to contact Samsung. All in all, this is a great television. I love this Smart Samsung TV more than my BIG screen Samsung!

review_title: Slick TV
review_text: I recently purchased this tv along with the F6400 to replace a couple sets in the house. The picture quality is amazing. It replaced a B8500 (which was a great pre-3D tv) as the featured set in my house. Directv is coming today to hookup their Genie setbox. The main reason I purchased it was to use the RVU functionality without required a directv box in the room. The speakers aren't the greatest, so I would recommend surround sound. The set is ultra thin and there is basically no trim around the outside of the screen. I have limited space where it is installed, so this allowed for a slightly larger screen size.

review_title: A great tv, but beware of shipping hassles
review_text: This is a excellent set for the price; we are particularly pleased with the tuner. Take heed, however, of the risks inherent in having this sort of item shipped to you. The first time this was shipped to me, it was "lost" by the shipper (being a large item, it was not shipped UPS or the like but by a freight company)...both the shipper and Amazon were less than stellar in responding to this problem....after much time in the Amazon bureaucracy it was re-shipped, only to arrive in a giant truck that could not make it up my driveway. In retrospect, I would have been better off buying this item locally.

review_title: Amazon Comes Through...
review_text: Well, I see many reviews mentioning that the product was great but the experience was terrible. I am not sure what happened in my case, but my local Amazon delivery went absolutely flawlessly. I ordered my set on Saturday, and on Thursday, several voicemails were left for me to call and schedule my appointment. They were ready to deliver on Friday, but I preferred to roll it a day to Saturday so that my wife would not have to take the delivery. Besides, I hadn't bought my stand yet, and was probably agonizing over that as much as I had on which TV to buy.On Saturday, I called the carrier (not Eagle, not the 'new' Eagle... never heard of them, actually), and was given the cell number of the driver with my set. He told me he was figuring on a 2pm delivery, and he showed up at 1:30. He and his partner brought the TV in, uncrated and placed it on my new stand (bought Friday night), hooked in the HDMI cable, fired it up, ran the initial setup menu and left. Ten minutes total, with another five to hook up the home theater (do yourself a favor - prep your components and clean up your cables). By 2pm, I was watching the Winter X-Games in full HD. Frankly, I don't think even my local Circuit City could have made it any easier.As for the set, It cost $150 less than my 36" Non-XBR Trinitron that I purchased about five years ago, it's big (but not too big) and the picture is absolutely fantastic. If it lasts, I can't imagine a better deal. The quality is there (I even like the little accent light under the logo, and I am normally big on such things), the remote is incredibly easy to navigate, and the overall satisfaction I am feeling right now is on par with any purchase I have made in recent memory.I do not recommend things I buy to others. You need to do your own research and follow your own instincts (and perhaps the advice of professionals). I am willing, however, to say that my choice has worked out very well so far.

review_title: awesome is the only word that comes to mind
review_text: After much debating and waiting, I jumped on the opportunity to buy this set last week when the price dropped to $1179. I absolutely could not be happier. First off, the price was lowest anywhere, including refurbs. Then Eagle GL got the set here in 5 days (including weekend). The Amazon estimate was March 3, but on Feb 26 my tv was unpacked and shelling out some of the best picture I've ever seen. I want to give some props to Eagle GL/CEVA. Shipping was fast, both the delivery guys were very friendly and would not LET me sign the manifest before they unpacked and properly checked the tv, physically and electronically. I received a call from them as advertised and when asked to be called an hour before delivery there was no problems and on delivery day they called just like they said they would. Now back to the tv... Did I mention its the best picture i've ever seen? The only thing I would suggest is buyingDigital Video Essentials: Optimize Your Home Entertainment System (NTSC Component)to properly calibrate your system for less than 1/8th the price it would cost to have it done professionally. Upconverted DVD's look great via PS3. True HD games look equally amazing. Can't comment on the QAM tuner, as I have satellite, but even the SD picture looks much better than some of the other sets out there. Overall I've had a very good experience and look forward to spending a lot of time in front of this beast.

review_title: worst possible amazon experience
review_text: This experience started with excitement about the price. After watching this particular TV for several months, I was pleased to see the price drop to what seemed an excellent deal.I made the purchase innocently enough, though was struck that it may have taken up to three weeks before the product was available. Still, at that price I was willing to wait.After about a week, I received notice that my package was en route and would be here in a few days. On the day that it was to arrive however, I was informed that the package couldn't be transferred from shipper to shipper. Apparently the carrier who would deliver the TV to my door wouldn't accept it due to the fact that there was the sound of broken glass in the box.I contacted Amazon to tell them that I would be willing to wait for a replacement, but I would like to have it expedited. I was told that wouldn't be a problem, and I was informed that my request would have to go to another department. I was told that I would be contacted by the end of the day.Four days later, after not having heard back, I called Amazon. I was informed that the only shipping choice I had available was the specialty shipper, and that there was no possibility of expediting the packaging. It would arrive in 5 to 10 business days.At this point the wait for the television was getting too long, so I asked to cancel the order. I was sent an e-mail two days later stating that all of the e-mails that I had been sending were missed, and they asked if I would like to proceed or cancel. It was at this point when I called in and made it quite clear that I wanted this nightmarish business finished and that they should cancel the order immediately.It's now more than three and a half weeks since my card was charged and several angry conversations later -- I don't have a TV and I don't have a refund. The order details online state that the unit was successfully delivered to a city 70 miles away from me, and there is no sign that I've initiated a return. My credit card retains the original charge, which will start accruing interest soon, but Amazon has assured me that I will be refunded the full amount sometime within the next four (4) weeks.

review_text: Good picture, easy setup. Flimsy stand which does not tilt. Auto Volume feature does not seem to work; many stations too loud, too soft. This is true even with Firmware version 1014.1. There is no headphone jack, a major omission, especially for a bedroom size TV. You have to use the Sound Out jack for headphones, and then you loose the TV's volume control and mute function.

The remote/TV combo is very sluggish--it often requires pushing a button on the remote multiple times to get the TV to respond. Some of the features are also less than ideal--the minimum time for the sleep timer is 30 minutes (whereas many other TVs allow minimums of 10 or 15 minutes) and it takes navigating through a multitude of menus to do simple tasks, like setting the TV wake-up alarm or modifying its settings. Surely Samsung designers could have done better!

review_text: The TV is awesome. Though, it needs some more processing power because mine crashed and I dont know if it happen across or just a peculiar problem. I would expect wireless mirroring with laptop, tablet and phone. I think we have passed having to connect with HDMI just to share screen.

I did see some rainbow in the Avia disk but only on a fully white display. If I had to choose again, the outcome would be the same. Great product!

review_title: Fantastic And Affordable HUGE Television
review_text: I am very impressed with this Plasma TV. I bought mine at Costco and was a little wishy washy about which direction I should go between LCD & Plasma. Buying the Plasma TV was an excellent choice. I picked it up for around $[...] after instant rebates. Setup was extremely easy. When I first plugged my cable box into the TV I was disappointed with the picture. Then I found out I needed an HD box and had to tune to special HD channels (located in the 700 range on my cable providers box). Once this part of the puzzle was figured out I havent had any issues since. The stock remote is very easy to use, responsive and functional. I also hooked up a Tivo (Standard definition but great quality anyway) & a DVD player. I don't even want to go to the movies anymore after getting this set.I highly reccomend this unit to the TV buyer who wants a big fancy TV but doesn't want to take out a second mortgage on their house to get it!**UPDATE 9/5/07*** - I was watching this TV 65 days after I purchased it and the set shut off and would not go back on. At that point I could not get the TV to go back on no matter what I did. I did some research and learned this is a known panasonic plasma problem. Luckily I returned the TV to costco right under their 90 day return policy for a full refund. As much as I loved this TV I would now hesitate to recommend it to others.

review_title: Amazing - simply amazing
review_text: I've had this TV for approximately 2 weeks now - It's my first Plasma TV - replaced a 10 year old 46" LCD television. After visiting every local store and kicking tires - I was sold that Plasma was the way to go. The clarity of the picture - 160 degree viewing angle with no decline in picture quality and sharp picture during fast moving picture ( i.e. sports ) + the vivid sharpness of blacks / reds / oranges / greens / blues made it pretty easy decision.I went with the PANASONIC b/c of Consumer reports review of last years models. It was rated as best picture for non HD programming over any of it's competitors. Going shopping for these things locally is similar to buying a used car - b/c most stores won't show you anything but a HD signal - but I was able to get one store to show me a digital signal to a couple models and was able to view a DVD of TOP GUN on this and a few other models. Alot of brands will have a significant dropoff in quality from HD to digital signal - NOT this panasonic.The picture in HD is simply amazing. Clarity / sharpness / at all angles of viewing both near and far away from the screen. The speakers are very good too - I will play a movie through the Home Theatrre - but day to day viewing the speakers will be more than adequate for most viewers.The picture in non - HD programming - Comcast digital cable signal. About 85 % of the programming is pretty close to the same quality as High Def. Alot of the cable programming seems to be formatted in anticipation of High Def viewing and look very sharp and clear. Occasionally ( maybe 10 - 15 % of cable programming ) you'll get a feed that's not quite as sharp and ther'es a noticeable decline in picture quality from the HD or normal Digital programming. However - I've checked that same programming on my older CRT television - I found that the ( Non-HD programming with poor signal ) picture on the 50" plasma is the same quality as what I'm getting on my 20" non digital television. The only difference is that most of the programming is so much better in quality on this plasma TV that it seems like the picture isn't good for those few broadcasts. BUT - it's not poor picture from plasma Tube - it's just a bad signal that looks worse in comparison to the other channels and/or programming.*** Don't let a salesperson talk you out of this TV if you have a large pictue window. I almost decided against the Plasma tube b/c a circuit city salesperson said the reflection would annoy me with a large window in the room. We have a west facing picture window in the rear with a tree outside the window. There is reflection on this tube - but it's no different than the reflection you'd get with a standard CRT tube television. We just pull down the shades a bit - and we haven't noticed anything that would be bothersome when viewing a program. We bought it with the assurance that if the reflection was an issue we could swap it out for a LCD or other television. We're keeping the Panasonic Plasma!!!!I'm totally happy we bought this TV - and have no regrets for choosing the Panasonic. I'd buy this TV again in a heartbeat. The only thing I don't know about is the longevity of this type of tube - but I'll learn that over time. We spent 400 bucks on an in home 4 year service plan to accompany the TV. The marketing says it will last 27 years if viewed 6 hours per day - but I think that's a little optimistic. I did however learn in my research that this technology has been around for 30 or 40 years so I'm hoping that means there won't be any technical quirks to still work out.Jake

review_text: I got one of the refurbs from "warehouse deals". If there's a blemish on it, I didn't find it. Looks great! Picture quality is great! Didn't have to tweak for better picture as I've heard some other HDTVs require.Eagle Logistics called a day ahead to coordinate delivery; very professional.Overall, I feel like I got a great TV for a very good price.

review_title: This Is the TV to Buy
review_text: All TV's lose brightness as the years pass. To my surprise I have discovered that the latest generation plasma TV's, such as this one, actually maintain brightness better than the old cathode ray tubes did. Therefore this TV will last even longer than the one it is replacing.Projection HD TV's on the other hand, fade in brightness far more quickly than you are used to. And LCD HD TV's, although good in brightly lit rooms, have a limited viewing angle that this TV does not. Your preferred choice is now clear, Plasma HD TV. Go to the Panasonic website to make sure you are actually buying the latest one. Currently this is the TH-50PX60U model.So what can you expect your viewing experience to be with an HD big screen TV anyway? You will have a lot of learning to do. First of all, you will find that most of what you actually watch is not available in HD. No DVD is in HD. TiVo will not display in HD unless you have a Direct TV satellite dish and a special HD TiVo receiver. It may be a challenge for you even to get true HD at all even after you upgrade your digital cable box to HD.DVD's you watch will look near to HD quality, even though they are not actually in HD. Good quality regular TV programming will also look good even if it is not actually in HD. Some TV programming will look absolutely awful on your HD big screen, however, and horrible flaws in resolution and detail that were not visible before will make some programming actually unwatchable.You will soon be able to tell which programs were actually filmed and which were recorded with video cameras, due to the color blotching all video cameras leave. Horrible stage makeup on some faces that you couldn't even see before will also become noticeable when watching some shows!If you do not hook your HD digital cable box up correctly, you won't be able to see HD even on the HD channels. You must hook up the composite video (three video and two audio jacks) or the HDMI or DVI connectors to get the HD feed. If you use the normal video output (one video and two audio jacks or the s-video) you will get a 480 interlaced non-HD picture by mistake.Old fashioned TV is 480 interlaced. Some DVD players have 480 progressive scan. This HD TV has native 720 progressive scan HD. Another common format is 1180 interfaced HD. 1180 progressive will be coming eventually. 720p is currently thought to flicker less than 1180i. 1180p isn't even available yet. 1180i is translated perfectly into 720p on this TV nonetheless so you can watch all modes and will be able to continue to watch all modes for some time to come.This TV has a 10th generation plasma screen, with a remarkable 10,000:1 contrast ratio. Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones is truly remarkable to view on this TV even in 480p mode which is the best you can get off of a DVD.Nowadays you can pick up a micro fiber cleaning cloth at auto parts stores. When using one of those you can feel the grip of invisible dirt even upon surfaces that look clean. However, I feel no grip at all when dusting this TV, leading me to surmise that the glass surface of this TV has been somehow microscopically perfected. And I am glad to say that little dust seems to be sticking to it.On this TV I can split the digital cable wire and get non-scrambled true HD TV channels directly off the cable wire without even using the HD cable box or the composite or HDMI inputs. For scrambled HD TV, the DVI feed from the HD cable box goes to the TV's HDMI input for true HD and the S-Video feed from the HD cable box goes to the TiVo for non-HD TV. You will be able to record HD programming from your digital HD cable box on your TiVo, only the programs will automatically get changed to 480i non-HD from using the S-Video output connector from your cable box. The HD channels will still look better than normal, however, even after you switch back to your TiVo to see something on an HD channel that you recorded in 480 mode. You will want to be there to watch programs on HD channels live in true HD now, of course, instead of later on as recorded by TiVo.You will find yourself to be ahead of the curve. Your TiVo won't work correctly. Most channels won't be in HD. Your DVD's will all be in the old format. And your cable guy won't have the slightest idea how to actually hook you up to see actual HD, so don't let him or her walk off with the 5 wire red green blue and audio composite video cable you will need!And Eureka, you will know instantly once you actually get true HD on your new TV! Even though there are only a handful of HD stations at present (Discovery HD, ESPN HD, TNT HD, InHD, InHD2, ABC HD, NBC HD, CBS HD and Fox HD and one HD feed for each of the four movie channels) you will find you only want to watch whatever is on in HD instead of whatever you used to watch before. Get ready for a life changing experience, therefore. But let them take a while to get those HD DVD's rolling, so you don't have to replace your entire collection of movies with a new format again so soon after having just changed them all!

product_name: Syntax Olevia LT30HV 30-Inch HD-Ready Flat-Panel LCD TV
review_score: 5
review_title: Great Product. Exceeded expectations
review_text: I did a great deal of research and shopping around before committing to the Syntax/Olevia 30" set. From what I found, there is no other product out there of this quality and image level at this price point. Hats off to Syntax for a great product. The unit performs as good or better than expected based on other reviews I have read. Many bad comments on the remote, but mine works fine from just about any distance, but is a little sensitive to angle. FYI If you have a universal remote, you may not find Syntax codes in the manual, so try the various RCA codes available... one of these should probably work... it did with my SA Cable Set Top Universal Remote.I have not seen the TV operate with and HD input yet. Still anxiously waiting for my cable company to come out and hook me up. The quality on standard Digital Cable is still outstanding, exceeding my expectations, even on an S-video input. I plan to use the DVI-D interface for HD Cable ..... can't wait! DVD's are awesome when using Component inputs (Y Pb Pr). Sound is fine with built in speakers... not great, but more than acceptable. I did not notice the audible noise or humm that others reported.The unit is very sleek and stylish and put together well. It would make a nice addition to anybody's home theater or bedroom, which is where we have ours set up.

review_text: Pro's Great picture both on TV and PC and perfect size for computer screen. The HDMI connection improved my PC's performance with repsect to both video and audio. (you must hook your computer to TV using an HDMI connection so make sure your computer has one) Cons: There are only 2 HDMI connections, The moniter does not swivel or move The remote is not universal so it cannot be programmed but is needed to change the functions on the TV since the button to change the functions on the TV is difficult to naviage.

review_title: Panasonic 50 inch plasma HDTV
review_text: I purchased this TV for the living room after purchasing a Panasonic 42 inch HDTV. I wanted a larger one for the living room. This TV is wonderful as is the 42 inch. Both have such vivid color and the sound is terrific even though I have a surround system. Sometimes I don't even use the surround system. Both TV's have dual speakers that can be easily heard. I would recommend Panasonic to everyone! (It arrived within 5 days, by the way...fantastic! Amazon is the only way to go!!!!!)

review_title: This is definately the one to buy...
review_text: This product is awesome. Fast, secure delivery from Amazon, and the unit itself is fantastic. Deliberated long over different makes, models, screens at BestBuy; then they pulled their overnight (Sunday night) price changes and it went up almost $600 (on President's Day weekend, no doubt, and with no warning from the sales person). Of all, this was the best looking screen in my opinion. It's like Tide with whiter whites and the true blacks are better than any LCD. The controls and menu displays are very easy and intuitive, lots of options, rear AND side connectivity, and relatively simple and straight forward. I love it. Oh, yeah...and after the price hike at BestBuy, I found it on Amazon for less than BestBuy had ever listed it .

review_title: A Fantastic HD Picture
review_text: I'll make this short and sweet. I purchased this Samsung 32" LCD TV through Amazon for about $1,000. All the local stores had list prices that were several hundred dollars more and Amazon had free shipping and no tax. It was a fantastic deal via Amazon. The TV set is absolutely fantastic.That 4000 to 1 contrast ratio really make the difference between a super picture and a so-so picture. So....folks...when you buy a LCDTV make SURE the contrast ratio is at least 3000 to 1 or better.. This is one of the most important specifications to check when deciding on your HD TV purchase. A low contrast ratio gives you a "washed out" picture. Go check a 32" LCD HDTV (that sell for $600 to $700) and you will see the difference because of the low contrast ratio.Lecture is over :-]I should mention however that I did have some trouble with Amazon's shipper. They were several weeks late getting it to me because, somehow, they had an old, obsolete area code for my telephone number and couldn't get in touch me to set up a shipping time delivery window. So they simply FORGOT about me until I finally called them and started raising cain. It took several telephone calls and e-mails to get things straightened out. Very poor service from Amazon's shipper. How they got a long obsolete area code for my phone is anybody's guess. I didn't give it to them.

review_title: A great TV at a great price
review_text: This LCD HDTV would be a great television even at a higher price, but at it's current price point it's hard to see why anyone would buy anything else. I got mine the day after Thanksgiving, and have been watching it every day since. I have a good friend with an Aquos, and though it's far more expensive, I can't see any difference. I sure don't miss my old CRT TV . . .I agree with the criticism that the volume is too high at the minimum setting - but it isn't a major annoyance. I believe they've fixed the remote-code issue as well, but in case you are still wondering, the volume, on off and channel selection use RCA code 001.Buy it now - once you go flat you'll never go back.

review_title: The TV is well done but AllShare software is barely usable
review_text: I want to say first that the actual TV itself is a wonderful piece of electronics. First off the picture quality is incredible. 3D works perfectly and easily for videos designed for 3d and those that aren't. The features of the product are too numerous to mention. It exceeded my expectations in every way. The problem is the AllShare software. It is cumbersome and difficult to use. Refreshing your shared files from your computer takes a very long time and often doesn't work correctly at the end. I find myself refreshing and waiting, refreshing and waiting, etc and finally forced to give up, shut the program down, restart and wait again and then MAYBE it actually refreshes. When it does, finally, refresh then more likely than not it no longer recognizes the TV and must be shut down and restarted again and again until finally and apparently through random chance the TV is again recognized. The troubleshooting and help provided is incomplete or nonexistent. To put it simply I absolutely love the tv, and with equal emotion HATE the software. Please work harder to create a better software solution for what is really a very simple task. Your smartphones are great, maybe ask for some help from the Android software producers to fix this miserable junk AllShare program.

review_title: Great TV
review_text: My only real complaint about the TV is the cheap plastic stand. It looks fine, but I wish it was more sturdy. The remote is really handy since it will control my Directv, although, it takes a few more motions than it would with the actual remote. The 3d is amazing and I have no complaints regarding blur other motion related imperfections. Since I feel that Samsung is the best, I was willing to pay a little extra. The speakers are terrible, but that's the case with any LED tv I've seen. I use the Samsung Airtrack soundbar, which is awesome.

review_title: TV Excellent. Shipping Nightmare.
review_text: This television is excellent at least as far as picture quality goes, especially in high definition.The problem I had was the shipping method. The included shipping ("free shipping") was via Eagle who lost the item for two weeks. I only found out that the item was lost one month after it was ordered and after several phone calls to Eagle. Amazon only offered to cancel the order or ship another TV. Before I could respond to Amazon, the item arrived by a third party (not Amazon or Eagle) five weeks after the order was placed.I would recommend paying extra for proper shipping.

review_title: Better than Bravia
review_text: First of all I have to say that this is my first hdtv, I've seen plety of others at work and friend's and family homes and out of all of them this is my favorite. I spent plenty of time researching which set to get and lots of trips to Best Buy and Circuit City showed me that this was the one to get. Right after I ordered my set, my sister purchased a 52" Sony Bravia for nearly double the price of my set ($3000 vs $18XX) and though her set is amazing, mine was a much better deal considering the features and picture quality are nearly identical between the 2 units. When using the same source material any differences were usually in this sets favor.Common Issues: Others have complained about buzzing (mine only buzzes with a fully white screen), poor sound quality (sound quality is average for a tv nothing terrific or terrible), etc. Out of all of the problems I've read about in reviews the only one that I have is with the set generating heat, but it isn't that bad.Amazon and Eagle: Ordering the tv was obviously quick and easy and the set shipped the same day. Tracking the package wasn't as easy, but then I didn't try very hard to find Eagles site and tracking tools, so I used Amazon's and they didn't offer a lot of info. Delivery was quick and painless, the guys were in and out within 10 minutes and took the packaging with them. The price on the set dropped a couple of times since my purchase and Amazon issued refunds within hours of me emailing them about it.Conclusin: All in all it was a great experience and I'll definately buy my next Samsung hdtvs through Amazon.

review_title: Great TV, poor delivery and return policy
review_text: I researched for several weeks to select this particular TV. Loved the LED engine and not having to replace a bulb every 3-5 years. Ordered the TV on 8/28/2007, it shipped on 8/29, I received the TV on 9/7. The delivery man and I carried the TV into the house, unboxed it and discovered that the TV screen was physically cracked. The TV was dropped in shipping, either from the manufacturer to Amazon or from Amazon to me. The box showed no indication of being dropped. We reboxed the TV, carried it back out and put it back into the delivery van. Called Amazon immediately. Got the run around. Spent about 30 minutes on the phone. Amazon wanted to wait for the TV to return to them, then credit my account and I could buy another TV. Amazon finally said that they would send a replacement for the broke TV. The replacement shipped on 9/12/2007, 5 days after I called. Amazon had to confirm that the shipping company was in possession of the broke TV, so it took until Monday 9/10 for the shipping company to complete the necessary paper work. I received the replacement TV on 9/18 from the same delivery company and delivery man. This time the TV was in perfect shape. As far as the purchase process, Amazon was tolerable and the TV is GREAT, especially on the HD stations. Football, Soccer and Baseball on ESPN HD is incredible. I gave a 5 star rating because I am rating the item not the service. Amazon and the delivery service would receive a 3 star rating.

review_title: Samsung FPT-5084: 1-month owner's review
review_text: I have divided this review into four parts: (1) My research on TVs before purchase (2) Post-purchase pre-delivery nail biting :-) (3) Connecting different components (4) Summary. Here goes!I did a fair amount of research on what TV to purchase before buying the Samsung FPT-5084. I am a first-time flat-screen HDTV buyer, and was caught in the Plasma-LCD dilemma for a couple of months. My initial reaction was to go with LCD because I was worried about the "burn-in" problem with Plasma TVs. I stood at a Best Buy store and stared at Plasma/LCD TVs for nearly two days (freaked out the customer service guys :-)), and the choice between Plasma/LCDs boils down to the tradeoff of "burn-in" in Plasmas versus the "triple ball effect" in LCDs. The newer models do significantly eliminate these issues, but there is always a freak chance of it happening. The biggest difference is that the picture in LCDs is much brighter than Plasma. In hindsight, LCDs are too bright for home viewing, and you are better off with Plasma. For me, it finally boiled down to a choice between the Samsung LNT-4671 or the Samsung FPT-5084, and given the size of our living room (viewing distance of 12 feet), the 50" was the right decision. The 46" would have been a tad small, and I am glad that I went for the 50".If you are purchasing the Samsung FP-T5084 (or any Plasma, for that matter) on amazon.com, do not purchase the extended warranty (available for around $300 for 4 years). It does not cover "screen burn-in", and in fact the manufacturers warranty also does not cover burn-in even during the warranty period. If your plasma has a screen burn-in one day after purchase, it still is your headache! This is a risk that you take when you purchase a Plasma (albeit, a small risk), but of course, you get better picture quality when compared to LCDs. However, if you purchase the TV at Best Buy (or Circuit City), the store warranty does cover burn-in problems, but the TV in stores is nearly $600 more expensive than on amazon.com, and with the extended warranty will be nearly $1000 more. I decided to take the risk, rather than spend the extra bucks.I purchased the Samsung FPT-5084 from amazon.com on Feb 19th, and it was delivered on Feb 27th by Eagle USA. This is typically longer than usual (from what I gather from other reviews) with the average delivery time being 5 days. Eagle USA has been purchased by Ceva Logistics (http://www.cevalogistics.com/portal/page/portal/CEVAHome), and you can get a reasonably accurate delivery estimate from the website. One important thing: If Ceva Logistics does not have your phone number on file, then they will deliver the item without calling you beforehand. To avoid this, I called them (based on the tracking information on the website) and pre-arranged a delivery date + time. The customer service is not very professional during the call, but the actual delivery is done in a good fashion. They bring the TV and install it for you, including a very basic cable connection. Do not expect them to hook up all your components (such as surround sound, etc.). Make sure that you check all the components including physical damage, TV sound, remote control functions, etc. before signing the acceptance letter.I hooked up this TV to a Bose Lifestyle V30 system, which is also 1080p compatible. (I got a professional installation done by Geek Squad, and they are really good.) I used HDMI cables (Monster 1000HD HDMI cable), which is the only 1080p compatible HDMI cable, and the picture quality is great! I was truly blown away with the vibrant colors and surround sound (from my Bose system). The cables you use to connect your TV to different components make a huge difference; so, do spend the extra bucks to get the best possible HDMI cables. To address the other issue of "glare" in Plasma TVs. My TV is placed close to a window, and there is adequate sunlight in the room, but so far, I have not seen any glare/reflection issues, but I do keep the blinds closed. There is no "buzzing sound" coming from the TV either (as I read in other reviews), and the TV does not get hot even after continuous viewing for over 5 hours. Unfortunately, I am not much of a gamer, and can offer no opinions on the subject.Overall, the TV is really really good, and the only reason why I give it 4 stars is because if you do not wish to connect it to a surround sound system, you might be a little disappointed with the sound effects. My surround sound installation was done a week after I got the TV; so, I could make out the difference between the original TV sound and the Bose system. There is no comparison...the original sound pales in comparison. But, again, it isnt too bad either.One final comment: While Pioneer and Panasonic seem to have the bulk of the Plasma TV market, I think the Samsung FP-T5084 matches up really well with its competitors at a much lesser price. I did not see any Pioneer sets, but I did compare this TV to Panasonic TVs, and I liked this one better.Hope this input helps all the potential buyers. Good luck in making an informed decision and happy viewing!

review_title: Everything but the fancy remote.
review_text: As a TV this thing is phenomenal. I have yet to be disappointed with any visual aspect of this TV. It looks great in my living on or off. The border-less frame as been a huge like by all my friends and family. I have actually recommended this TV to several friends all ready. However for the first month I was trying to use the remote and found the reaction time to be slow, and also it felt very awkward using it. I did try to use it for several weeks thinking it might have a learning curve. Voice controls worked fine but felt to me like a gimmick. The touch pad number system was great until you had to dial in a 1000+ number. The remote I replaced with a Logitech harmony remote and all issues on that front are now solved. The smart TV has been awful and i have practically stopped using the features associated with it. I also own an AppleTV which is superior. It seems slow and most of the Favorite channels it thinks I like I never watch. I actually blame the remote for continuously putting in wrong channel numbers. Since i have purchased a new remote i have been happy again with this TV. Other issue has been the set up through a AV receiver but i am working that out and do not believe that the TV is at fault. This TV is absolutely stunning in 1080 and 3D/3D upconvert, and I have already recommended to friends as stated earlier.

review_title: Very Pleased
review_text: I have had this TV for 3 months and have no problems with it. The picture is stunning in HD and non-HD programming isn't bad. There is no bad viewing angle which was one of the reasons I chose plasma. I have played XBOX 360 connected through HDMI with no ill effects and it looks great, much better than my rear projection HDTV. Movies in 1080p are amazing. I can't think of anything I'm unhappy with. I have never heard any buzz or hum that others have spoke of. A great buy.

review_title: Fantastic Television
review_text: The LNS3251D is simply a fantastic buy at around $1,000. Only a more expensive Sony could possibly best this television.If you're looking for a leading-edge, top of the line TV, this is the one to get. You don't need increased contrast like the higher end Samsungs; this one is deep and dark enough to please even the most critical eyes. Keep in mind that besides adjusting contrast and brightness, this set has an "E Saving" mode which will dim the back light considerably. This enhances contrast a GREAT deal. And with the two HDMI inputs, you're set for cable/sat. box with HDMI connectivity and a high-definition DVD player when they're affordable.I used to sell televisions (up to about a year and a half ago) and on my way out I noticed how amazing the Samsung LCDs were becoming. Now, with these current models, they really go toe-to-toe with the Sony Bravia XBR models. And you can't beat that, I'm pretty sure of that. The Samsung is not only the most physically attractive TV but it simply provides the best picture for the size and price point. The piano black is beautiful, the connectivity is perfect, the remote is user-friendly, and the settings are diverse enough to get the picture just the way you'd like it.Amazon also seems to continually have the lowest price on this TV and shipping from Eagle is great. They make sure the screen is not damaged before leaving and they're very polite. That's saying a LOT for any delivery team. I do recommend CALLING them as soon as you track the item as being in your state. You can probably set up delivery for 1-3 days from that point, but if you wait for them to deliver on their own, it will take longer. They seem to prioritize the deliveries setup over the phone.So again, if you're still deciding on a TV, this is the ONE to get. Keep in mind that out of the box, any LCD tv needs some proper adjusting. I've dimmed the back light to the "medium" setting and played with the brightness/contrast/color to the point where the pictures look perfect and represent colors properly. You can pick yourself up (or even rent) a calibration DVD to simplify this task.ONE con about this TV is the sound, as many others have mentioned. It is poor. Very poor. I have it hooked up to a surround sound system in my bedroom anyway, so if you're planning on using the TV's speakers, don't be surprised by the muffled sound. Samsung still hasn't gotten that right yet, but I don't care about that - the picture is perfect.

review_title: Great TV for the price
review_text: I have had this TV for about 6 months now, and I have been very happy with it. My only complaint would be that to change sources you have to cycle through all of them. There is a way to select them through the main menu, but it takes you just as long to get to that menu as it does to cycle through them.I thought glare would be an issue since it is installed in a room with a patio door, but I rarely notice the glare. The glare is significantly less noticeable than the CRT it replaced. The CRT used to drive me crazy. I think the flat screen coupled with a tilting wall mount is a big reason for the difference.Sometimes it seems to have a slightly greenish tint to the picture, but I think that is mostly associated with the source. I only notice it every now and then.I do worry sometimes about burn-in, but I have not had any issues yet. I don't treat it very special (watch shows in letterbox & with side bars regularly), but I am conscious about not over-doing it and I try to vary things. I would say I'm only slightly more careful than I was with the CRT.Overall, I'm glad I did not buy an LCD instead. At the time I got this I would have had to pay about $600 more for an LCD with similar performance.I sit about 8 feet from the screen, and I think it is a perfect size. In some scenes you actually feel like you are flying.

review_title: Great Price, Better TV
review_text: This TV is awesome. I did alot of research before buying this TV. First let me say that the only other TV that even an option is the Sony. But for the price and the fact that this TV has an LED engine not a bulb pushes it ahead. This television has every option you can need and looks great. At this point I only have basic cable, not even digital cable, however it has a built in HD digital tuner, so I am watching 1080i broadcast in HD, and I have a very good, but not HD dvd play which looks amazing as well. Once the satilite with HD programing comes and with the use of the HDMI/DVI cable I am expecting even better picture. Now looking for the correct DVD player to get 1080p picture. Amazon was great from start to finish, the white glove delivery was including in the price as well. This same model, and make sure when you go shopping for price that you are looking at the same model, there are a few with close model numbers but are not LED, was $2599.00 at the local store plus tax, plus delivery, which you would want, even if you have a truck, if you damage it while bringing it home its on your tab. I paid almost a grand less, total including setting on my stand and the driver stays until you make sure it works. This is the TV to buy. I could not be happier.

review_title: awesome tv
review_text: This is a great TV. I am not an expert on TVs but from what I have read this TV should last. The fact that it is a projection screen turned me off at first, but I decided to go against my instincts and buy this one because of the LED backlight. This screen is not like other projections, it does not get darker when you look at it from the side (although it does if you stand over it and look down). The picture is adjustable from 16:9 to 4:3 and to two different zooms. It has a digital antenna tuner as well as a cable input so you can have an antenna and a cable box hooked up at the same time. It has three HDMI inputs etc. The delivery service took about a week and a half and the they carried the TV inside, took it out of the box, and turned it on to make sure it worked. The TV and box arrived in perfect condition. No problems yet and hopefully not for a while.

review_title: Nice high tech TV
review_text: I finally took the plunge and purchased a TV that's current with the new technology and more advanced than the one I replaced. It is pretty sharp with nice color that closely match the skin tones and this is viewing with the HD channels. The only drawback is I still have to use my FIOS box to view the channels which I'm Ok with but it would have been nice. This TV is so light in comparison with my old one and you can slightly swivel it in both direction. I also like the fact that it has sufficient HDMI inputs for my needs as well as a component input since I have not purchased a new DVD player yet. It is nice to be able to have the wifi capability but I don't think I will be using it to replace my laptop and iPad. One to keep in mind about the 3-D glass is it requires battery to use it, however, I'm not a 3-D user so I don't really have to worry about replacing the battery.

review_title: Great Tv
review_text: Ordered on a Sunday and got a call on Thursday. TV is perfect. I orded the previous model from Amazon last Christmas and received 3 lemons before I just requested my money back. Had no problems with this one. Will always by my large ticket items from Amazon. By the way, after I bought the TV for $2125, I kept an eye on the price. Amazon gave me 5 seperate price matches until my 30 day period was up and I ended up only paying $1899. Can't beat it.

review_title: Review Samsung LNT4061F purchase from Amazon.com
review_text: For months, I knew I wanted to purchase a new HD flat LCD 40 inch television. After reading the many positive customer reviews on the Amazon.com site, I knew it had to be Samsung. It was a very good choice. I placed the order on October 8. Amazon said they shipped it on October 9, and it would be delivered by Eagle USA freight service on October 18. I received a phone call from Eagle USA that the television would be delivered on October 16. The driver called that he would be late, but he did arrive at a reasonable time. He removed my old one, unpacked the new television, installed my new one and hooked it up. Terrific. You can't ask for more than that. The picture is terrific and color is dynamic. It is as good as everybody said it was, and I am happy with my purchase, including the service by Amazon.com. Also, the price was $200 cheaper with free shipping and no sales tax compared to any local purchase, even though, Amazon.com seem to be increasing the price weekly. This was a good buy.

review_title: LOVE this tv
review_text: I bought this TV about a month ago and I'm VERY happy with it. I got mine through Electronics Expo through Amazon and shipping was a cinch. It came earlier than expected and the shipper emailed me a tracking number. I've really had no issues with it, other than some random clicking noises when I first turn on the thing and then again when I turn it off. It doesn't seem to affect the tv performance at all. I have yet to hook up a gaming console but the HD quality through my cable channels is amazing! I also have my Apple TV hooked up to it and its fantastic. I have mine in my tiny one bedroom apartment and its the perfect size. No complaints, quality is great and the tv is light enough to lift on my own.

review_title: One word...cheap
review_text: To be honest, I don't have this exact product. I have it's 'twin', the Syntax Kolin DLT-2711M. A few weeks shy of two years of ownership, the television died, for lack of a better word. At that point, the power off LED would not be lit but the television would not be on and I could not turn it on. Unplugging the television for a time served as a temporary fix, but now the tv is out completely. My suspicion is that it's a bad power supply (while it didn't solve the problem, I noticed upon inspection that the AC socket 'legs' had broken from the PS and needed to be re-soldered).I've noticed other reviews with a similar problem - the blue/black screen of death. A Yahoo group devoted to Syntax LCDs has solved that problem if you're interested. While not the same issue I have, they both stem from cheap construction - substandard components and shoddy manufacturing.That being said, the television performed adequately while it worked and was rather inexpensive. In fact, Syntax-Brillian has continued to market budget-conscious LCD TVs with some success. Ultimately, you get what you pay for and that includes customer service (however, Syntax's tech support is reportedly more helpful if you actually get through to them). I think next time I'll buy from a more reputable manufacturer.Caveat emptor.

review_title: Very good tv
review_text: So far so good, just got it about a week ago and it looks very nice. Shipping was a pain, as I did free shipping and it took about 2-3 weeks to get it and then I had to take off work to get it delivered but Eagle was held up at a prison due to a random search that took a long time so they missed the 4 hour window and delivered it that night. The person who sets up the delivery gives you a phone number for you to get a hold of them, but it just goes to a machine and they call you back hours later. I had to look for info online and get amazon to call the delivery truck to set up a new time since they missed the delivery window. Very, very inconvenient.I haven't yet calibrated it, but looking online, I've found avsforum.com to be a very good source of info on calibration and problems associated with these sets and others.http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=847465You can also try this for calibration:http://www.hometheatermag.com/advicefromtheexperts/407cali/I have the tv mounted above my fireplace (looks nice) with the cords running through the wall out to the entertainment center (12 foot length minimum) so they aren't visible. I was originally going to run everything through a receiver and one cord to the tv but after reading up some more on the tv I found that it can control most of what I need (dvd player, cable box, vcr, etc) through the remote that comes with the tv. So all I need are long cables to make it to the receiver so I can watch my movies through 5.1 surround sound.You don't need expensive hdmi cables, they're digital and only transmit 0s and 1s so if $10 cables give you a picture, you can be sure the $95 monster cables will give you the exact same picture. That is unless you get into the hdmi version 1.3 or above (1.3a, 1.3b).check here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HdmiYou also don't need to get a hdtv antenna, just a regular old antenna or rabbit ears will work fine, I actually am not using anything for an antenna but can still pick up local hd stations over the air.I chose this one over the lnt4665f due to the screen reflection differences and the windows i have in my room. The real only notable difference is the contrast ratio being only 10000:1 versus 15000:1 on the 4665. That's due to the glass screen itself.Also remember to keep checking back on the price from day to day during the initial 30 day period of ordering it, I saved $80 just by seeing the price dropping and emailing customer service about it.

review_title: Super TV, Super service from Amazon, once again
review_text: I usually do not submit reviews, but we LOVE this TV and the service from Amazon. I ordered it on Monday, and even though the shipping date estimation was several days later, we received it on Thursday! Incredible! But, you must be flexible to be able to arrange home delivery with this delivery company. Luckily, I was able to work from home that afternoon. Anyway, great TV, great service. Highly recommend.

review_title: Better than expected
review_text: This unit has all the features I was looking for but the deal maker was the great price at a local electronics store and the overall dimensions. Perfect for my space! It was easy to set up especially with the Samsung how to videos on my smart phone while I was doing it! I did engage an online chat with Samsung and my cable provider to make sure I had the best connection. After a few adjustments bingo it was amazing! Easiest, smartest, and best TV purchase ever!

review_title: Awesome 1080P!
review_text: After a long series of struggles on which tv to get, I finally came up to a conclusion by purchasing the lnt 4061. At first, I was hesistant about this tv, since I've read tons of issues about this model. However, for the price of $1200 (price matched by sears, can you believe it?), the decision was too easy for me not to turn down a deal like this. I hooked up my PS3 right away, and was completely blown away. It performed very well. Colors are very accurate although, the blacks can be improved. The one prob that I can point out though, is the blinking problem. This only occur when you use an hdmi. Audio/Sound is pretty lame, but most people buy home theatre system anyways so that would help a ton. I was really impressed with the 4061. Hooked up the upconvert DVD player using 720p still is jaw dropping. HD channels makes you don't want to watch reg channels. Non HD channels are very blurry with this tv. But I only watch HD's so that doesn't bother me.

review_title: I Love this TV!
review_text: I purchased this TV to replace a 9 year old 55" Toshiba Theaterview TV. I love it! I am using it with a TiVo HD and service from Comcast. I am very impressed even with SD programming. On other HD TV's The pictures looks really bad and pixelated. On the HLT6187, it is viewable (Which is nice, as I still have about 30 hours of shows on my TiVo to get through).I purchased directly from Amazon.com. The delivery was awsome! I ordered on a Monday night. On Thursday morning I got a call to setup Delivery. By Noon on Friday, I was watching TV.My Next Purchase is a PS3 and a New Receiver :)I Highly Recommend this TV.

review_title: Let's be honest
review_text: In the world of flat screen HDTV there are 3 choices, plasma, LCD and projection. The problem with projection is you can't hang it on the wall. Bottom line is that a larger percentage of the LCD and plasma end up sitting on something, not hung on a wall. Samsung has got projection depth down to under 15" and delivers a picture that is every bit as good if not better than LCD or plasma. I have a wall unit that is 60" wide and 17" deep. This TV fits with about 2 1/2" on each side and is recessed from the front by over 2", looks almost built in and several people have made that comment.I wanted "big" and didn't want to spend a huge amount of money. The sound is adaquate but with the money I saved over the other types (at least $3,500) I can afford a really nifty system. Thank you Amazon, great price, awsome product, professional delivery at a price the the retailers can't touch.

I simply unplug it for a few seconds, plug it back in and the picture re-appears. But I can't complain, this TV cost $1000 less than a major brand. Todays price is even better. Makes a good TV for the kids room.James Dorsey, I too have not received my $100 rebate either. The manufature online rebate status has no record of my rebate.Amazon should look into this since they sold and promoted the rebate.

review_text: I'm very happy with my choice of 32" LCD TV. It looks very smart - shiny black stand and edge of screen, I like how the speakers are hidden away and don't make the TV wider than it needs to be. The picture is superb with HD digital cable. I haven't played around with the settings, I found the picture type I like and that's it so far.I ordered it online on a saturday evening, and I had it delivered to me the following Thursday, very impressive, and ahead of the expected delivery date from Eagle couriers.

review_title: Generally happy except for dead pixels
review_text: The picture takes a lot of adjustment but generally can be made to look pretty good. I like the stereo audio out feature to connect to older audio amplifiers. I'm a bit sad about dead pixels and hope the problem doesn't get worse. Currently, there is a dead color pixel and a cluster of 4 or so dead backlight pixels. I also think it's disingenuous to market the "120 Hz clear action" feature which when activated makes the picture too dim to watch.

review_title: WOW ! Amazing HDTV and Great Price
review_text: What can I say? This is one amazing television. I debated for quite awhile as to whether to buy an LCD or Plasma big screen TV and never even thought about DLP sets until I saw this one at BestBuy. I did a lot of research online, visited a few showrooms, and even had a chance to watch a movie at a friend's house on a smaller Samsung DLP set before making the decision to go with this technology over the LCD or Plasma.There is a slight warm-up time (maybe 30 seconds) when turning on the set and that appears to be normal and once it's on the picture is truly stunning. I just updated to HDTV through Direct-TV and it is very hard to watch "normal" TV anymore.I am very happy with this set and would recommend it highly.

review_title: Updated Feedback
review_text: The "device" arrived yesterday, and after moderate set-up, was displaying HD images of excellent quality. Clearly, this is consistent with many other folks who shared their experiences in this forum, and several others.The "white glove" service met my expectations, with the Eagle guy hitting his time window for delivery and removal from packaging.For those of you who may be somewhat reluctant to electronically execute a purchase of this magnitude, I can highly recommend Amazon's process. As a bargain hunter, I will be watching this site for the next 28 days to see if the price comes down, to "exercise" their price guarantee commitment.Update: Kudos to Amazon for honoring their post-order price guarantee, twice, during the 30 days after shipment. This saved a total of $124.30.

review_title: Excellent
review_text: I bought this TV 3 months back and I rate this TV as excellent.I have not had any problems and the picture quality is stunning. I am not able to distinguish any significant difference in picture quality between regular DVD and a Blue ray DVD. It is probably because the signals are upscaled and I get to see them in near 1080p mode. When I did my research I had narrowed down the list between panasonic TH50PZ700U, TH50PZ770U (has a couple of advantages over 700U - one extra hdmi input and auto tuning to best quality replay of some dvds) and the Samsung FTP 5080. The samsung came with the extra hdmi input and its contract ratio was 15000:1 as opposed to the panasonic which was 5000:1.

review_title: I love this TV
review_text: I looked long and hard before deciding to buy this TV. If money were no object I would have probably bought a comparably sized LCD tv but that would have cost at least twice [maybe 3 times] the price of this set. The only benefits to an LCD are the flatness for wall mounting and viewing angle. Neither of these issues affect me so I am really happy with the tv. The picture is great. It displays my computer via hdmi really well. And the built in sound is very good as tv's go. It has all the needed inputs and outputs to do just about anything you might want to. I also really like the fact that I dont have to deal with bulb replacement.

review_title: Great TV for the price, speakers are so so
review_text: I think this is a great tv for the money. Great size screen for the money. I mainly bought it over a plasma because no burn in when playing video games for my kids, and the led technology takes the worry out of projection like you have with the bulb/wheel dlp setup. The speaker system is not near as good as my old Toshiba Cinema Series rear projection tv, but it is okay for normal viewing. For movies everybody including me uses a theater surround sound system anyway, but I do view alot of tv at night with the sound provided by the tv, and bass is sadly lacking.I did not have any of the halo effect with this one, and I am pretty sure with the ones Amazon sells that end in SAX, Samsung has fixed this problem.I have noticed though that you still get a ghosting effect in the center of the screen from top to bottom. It is simply caused by any reflection in your room, whether it be a ceiling light above, or in my case a light reflection off the hardwood floor from a nearby window. When the set is on and a picture is present, you don't notice it, but if the screen goes dark or black for a second you can see it. I try to watch with low lights and the blinds closed during the day.I had a Samsung rep. out to verify the above mentioned ghosting was not in fact the halo effect others have experienced, and while he was out he made several adjustments to help with incorrect screen geometry, centering of the picture, and focus. I now know how to do those things myself because I saw him do it, so that is nice in case I need to change anything minor later.As for picture adjustment, the standard, movie, or dynamic settings as they come default are not right at all in my opinion. I fought with it for about a week, and broke down and bought Digital Video Essentials to help me calibrate the picture. I think it looks great now, and I am sure a Pro calibration might look a little better, but I am happy with mine the way I did it, and saved $300 to $500 to get it done professionally.Overall, happy so far.The only thing left to do is buy an extended warranty, and you have to do it before 90 days from the end of your standard 1 year warranty or it's too late.

review_title: Couldn't be Happier
review_text: Bought this TV in October 2007 (from Amazon)after spending that summer doing all kinds of research (especially Plasma vs LCD comparisons) I choose to with this Samsung/Plasma due mostly to its competitive pricing, picture quality and standard features. I LCD's at the time were still behind the Plasmas with picture quality. I originally wanted a 42" but went bigger and I am so glad I did.Now lets get down to what you are reading this review for. Once purchased it took about a week for delivery (which for me was way too long but I did have time to find a TV stand). If you are going from a SD TV to a HD TV (as I did) then you will be amazed at the picture quality especially if you are a sports fan. Now SD channels are not that good but are better that a regular TV with 4:3 pull down. Also I switched from Comcast to DirectTV due to the picture quality. Comcast has to use a video compression technique to get HD over the coaixal cable which henders quality.Out of the box I had a low sounding buzzing noise that was intermittent and if I turned the volume up I wouldn't hear it. It kinda bothered me at first but I go over it. After reading some forums alot of people experince this with Plasma it's just to what volume level can you tolerate it. Samsung is aware and have some remedies. Also be aware this TV gets hot and expands the plastic molding which will make a crakling sound from time to time (you will also hear this when you turn the TV off). This issue/concern is addressed in the owners manual. This is just a by product of having a Plasma TV.After adjusting all the available picture settings I was completely satisfied with picture quality. I have a PS3 (HDMI) and XBOX 360 (Component) and both are beautiful to look at. Please be advised that additional adjustments may be neccessary to get the picture the way you want it. I could write more on this but its my vision vs yours. So remember its what you prefer not me. I am just very pleased with the HD and SD picture quality. I highly recommend this TV.I do have to say I do get compliments from others (mostly friends and family) on the picture quality they see on this TV.Now I did have a bit problem that drove me crazy for awhile. Late January 09 I started noticing this rapid pixel flicker of red and green color in dark areas of video content. It only seemed to happen after the TV had been on for awhile (sometimes 30min to 2hrs). I think is was tempeature related. Oh by the way the backt top of the TV gets really hot. So if you have children please be aware of this. Now back to this flickering of pixels you had to be about 3-5 feet away to really see it but after about a month of this I could see it from my standard sitting distance (which is exactly 10ft).I called Samsung support and even after a year still issued a warranty work order. The tech that came out could see it (that was good to know because my girlfriend said I was obessed with this. Unfortunately the tech just oredered a power supply board and that realy didn't fix it. So I called Samsung back and they issued another warranty claim and the TV repair shop said we will get you an interior display replacement (which replaces the display and all boards except power supply and input/output board.). So needless to say Samsung support has been GREAT to me.Overall--- Do your own research. Pick the TV that fits your budget and wants. You already know you need a TV. Don't be afraid to go big. Go online to the actual brand manfacturer to determine what the models are (entry level vs premium) and features they come with. Then go to the big retailers to actually see the TV. Do be skeptical of picture quality in the store. They use different settings than what you may use in your home. Remeber where you are putting this TV (pay attention to you surrounding light). Then shop Amazon becuase no sales tax. I would've paid over 1,000 more if I bought at the BB store. Also not every TV is perfect these are highly technical pieces of equipment and all brands have issues (as you will discover when you do your research). Its how they deal with those issues that sets them apart. As I have stated before Samsung has been great to me.Hope this review helped you in making an informed decission.

review_text: Bought the LN-S4095D directly from Amazon. Eagle shipping did keep their tracking data up to date so I was aware of when I would get the system. Eagle set it up. No problems so it was easy to sign off on it. Love the display.. Great system. Good price and there was even a price break and Amazon credited me the difference. Saved a lot of money over purchasing in a local store.

review_title: Samsung 52" 1080 LCD LNT5265F
review_text: My new Samsung worked perfect just out of the box. Amazon delivery was quick despite being a cross country freight trip. The price for the unit was far below Sears or other Electronic Stores in the area, a real value. Hooked the unit up to local HD Cable Service, great picture with very few adjustments needed. The picture is much brighter than a DLP of the same size and the Black Contrast is outstanding, an initial worry about buying a LCD over Plasma. The unit is in a room with floor to almost ceiling windows in the background, there is no problem with light reflection,even during mid day.Overall, I would highly recommend the unit and Amazon is the place to buy it.

review_title: Precautionary Tale
review_text: I recently purchased this item from Amazon and have no complaints about the TV. It is beutiful and operated flawlessly as expected. I have rated it 5/5.I am writing this review to warn potential buyers of the problems with Eagle Delivery service that Amazon utilizes. The service is advertised as "white glove" This includes delivery to your home, uncrating, setup and removal of packing materials. Amazon sent the unit out in less than 48 hours. The tracking service said it had arrived in Denver (the local hub 2 days latter.) There it sat for 4-5 days with me anticipating a call to arrange delivery. No call!! Eventually, through forums I was able to contact Eagle. First they said they had tried to contact us (We received no such call an the answering machine had no message) Then they said they would arrange the delivery in 1-2 days. Still OK we were excited. On the delivery day we received a call from the driver of the delivery truck inquiring if we were home and did we have someone to help him with the TV since he was alone. After several calls to Eagle (No answer and a hang up on hold for the "right person") I gave up. In the mean time the delivery man had found an assistant and they delivered it to the house. When asked about setup they replied "We don't do that, if something went wrong we would be blamed. We plugged in the TV and it seemed OK and they left.The TV is great, but watch yourself during the delivery process. I think the TV would still be in Denver if we were not pro-active. Shame on you Amazon for not monitoring this better.

review_title: 52" is NOT to big!
review_text: With so many great reviews on this product there is no reason for me to add my two cents, but since I like it so much I feel compelled to offer at least one point to ponder.During me research it didn't take long to figure out Samsung was the way to go and considering my living room size I was getting ready to buy the 46" model. Why?? I read the articles that talked about the amount of space you will sit from the TV should predicate the size of the TV you purchase. The logic seemed good to me until I visited some furniture stores with mock up living rooms that featured "real" televisions playing movies. After sitting in these mock living room arrangements and realizing that my living room was just a bit bigger (my TV is 8ft from my couch) and yet I still enjoyed the view of their 52" I decided to go ahead and but this TV despite the math. So, to all of you considering the advice of mathematicians I say hogwash! Go to a furniture store near you equipped like mine was and view for yourself. After all, think about the movie theater...I would like to seem them justify their math with that!Cheers!David

review_title: This is my perfect TV!
review_text: I cannot say enough about this TV. Picture is incredibly bright, crisp, with no noticeable geometry flaws my previous Hitachi 51" CRT had. The set is dead quiet and looks sleek on the Samsung TR-500X3B stand. PS3 Heavenly Sword, Ninja, and Warhawk all look mind-blowing on this unit. HD content via Comcast looks 3-D at times.Plus, at 1899.98 and free shipping this set is a steal!About the shipping... 1 elderly man arrived in a van, used a 2x4 as a ramp to drag the set out. I was cringing so I helped him carry it in. After we dragged the dirty box on my carpet we unboxed it, and dropped it on the stand. I had to convince him to stay while I hooked it up. Not so white glovey, but it was free shipping.The only bad thing is the no-bass tinny speakers so you will have to use your receiver for proper sound. Still, no regrets here. Would buy again.

review_title: Great 52" LCD TV
review_text: I've owned this tv almost a month and so far, it's been a pleasure watching. Plenty of HDMI connections, great picture, and not nearly as heavy as I thought.The only thing I would recommmend to someone buying it is invest in a Blueray or Hi-Def DVD player if you like watching movies. I got a playstation3 because it plays blueray disc's and it's a game console for the same price of the cheapest Bluray disc players out there. It will play your old dvd's as well and produce the best picture you can get from them like an upconverting DVD player. Keep in mind not all regular DVD's are the same quality and widescreen versions get the most out of the LCD shape.

review_title: Great HDTV
review_text: I bought one when Amazon was selling them. I've owned mine for around 3 weeks and it's been absolutely perfect. I'm getting my HDTV signal from 3 sources: Comcast HDTV receiver, PlayStation 3, and a Toshiba HD-DVD player. Everything looks incredible on this unit. Even the built in HDTV tuner picks up weak signals over the air very easily. I was watching lots of HDTV over the air before Comcast provided me an HDTV receiver. I paid $1899 with Free shipping from Amazon with the white glove delivery. Eagle delivered it with two guys who carried the TV into my house, unboxed it, and let me power it up to make sure it worked then removed all of the packing material. It was better than going down to Best Buy or Circuit City and picking one up myself. The box itself didn't have any scuff marks or anything. I'd actually trust Eagle more than I would a retailer. Anyway, I don't think it matters where you buy one, just as long as you do get one.

review_title: MOTION SQUARES..
review_text: My Second review: (2.5 Stars)Starting to get a ton of motion squares. Not sure if it's my provider, the tv, or my connection, but it really makes it unpleasent when watching anything in HD. Looking at other reviews, not seeing anyone else with the same problem...My first review: (5 Stars at the time)Wanted to review the TV after a few months of viewing..and I can happly say...I STILL LOVE IT!!! The only downside on this unit is..I wish every channel was in HD! Very happy with the clean housing and crisp LCD screen...rich colors. 3 HDMI ports are great, plus I can snap a USB memory key into the side to view images using a slideshow...very cool. A+ , would buy again.

review_title: Excellent HD Quality
review_text: The HD picture quality is fantastic. I looked at the Sony's and Toshiba's at the stores, but you couldn't beat the Samsung. It has all the hook-ups you will need too. I have Time warner cable with the HD package hooked up with HDMI cable. You will hate watching the basic channels though, as the 61 inch screen really brings out how bad the quality is. I hooked up my laptop with an s-video cable, and my pictures look pretty good. I only have a 3.1 megapixel camera, so I bet they would look excellent with the higher resolution camera's. My basic DVD player is hooked up with digital coax, and looks great. It has an extra HDMI input for a Blueray or HD player. The service from Amazon was fantastic. The shipping company brought it in the house and set it on the stand, and it arrived 5 days sooner than promised! The price went down $60 3 weeks after I bought it, and Amazon gave a credit back. No Shipping, and no Tax, how can you beat Amazon?

review_title: It's a keeper!... I think?
review_text: My kids received a PS3 for Christmas; therefore, I was thrown into the HDTV market. The kids insisted that I buy a 1080P TV. I tried to save a few hundred dollars and bought a Sceptre 42" 1080P and a Vizio 47" 1080P HDTV. I was not completely satisfied with my two purchases. I bought the Sony KDL-40V2500 40" a few days ago. Everyone in the family (including myself) are stunned by the amazing picture on this TV through Dish Network HD channels, PS3 blu-ray discs, and PS3 games. Standard TV and standard DVDs look really good too. I believe it's worth spending a few more bucks to get a superior product.I'm somewhat concerned over the cloud issues found on the web. I spoke to Sony today. They acknowledged the cloud issue with the Sony XBR HDTVs over the phone and their Sony website. However, they said the Sony KDL-40V2500 does not have a cloud issue. I do have some uneven backlight when the screen is black on blank. It doesn't seem to affect the picture quality. I don't want to return this TV if this should not be a concern. What's your opinion regarding this cloud controversy?

review_title: A beautiful TV after you adjust the settings
review_text: We had an eye on this TV for a while and snapped it from Amazon the day after Black Friday with a great price promotion. The out of box TV settings are not good for home use. You have to adjust it to fit your personal preferences. The most important settings you need to play with are: Picture mode(standard or custom), backlight, picture, brightness, color, hue, and sharpness. Remember, these settings are related to each other: increasing or decreasing one setting could impact the overall picture quality, not just that particular setting you adjusted. It took us three days to get to what we wanted. We connected an XBox360 to the TV and played a movie DVD through it; the picture is amazing, and the sound from the TV is as good as it is from our home entertainment system.Overall, this is a great TV to have.

review_title: WARNING - THIS SHIPPER DOES NOT OFFER PRICE PROTECTION!!!
review_text: Please note this review is simply meant to WARN purchasers that the 30-day price protection mentioned in many other reviews is NOT available through Electronic Express, which is currently the designated shipper. I purchased this item and the price dropped the following day; when I contacted Amazon they informed me that this particular shipper does not offer price protection. This was confirmed by Electronic Express. I have not received the tv yet and trust it will be a good purchase, but I was very disappointed about the price protection and probably would have looked for a seller that offered this if I had done my homework more thoroughly (in future I will make sure to click on the shipping policies link for any major purchase rather than rely on reviews). UPDATE: The tv arrived very promptly and well packaged, so the shipper gets high marks other than for the price protection policy. Set-up took me about two hours because I'm not the most tech savvy person, but the picture looks gorgeous, and the set has a nice swivel feature. To those using an antenna, make sure you switch the cable setting to "off" in the menu before performing the auto-tune function. The only drawbacks so far, as others have mentioned, are that the menus take some time to learn and there is a brief delay when switching channels. Amazon won't let me change the number of stars I gave, but I'd certainly give the set itself five stars.

review_title: Great TV for the price
review_text: I upgraded from a 32" Samsung LCD to this model and I couldn't be happier. Very glad I went with the 40" rather than the 46" because those six more inches would've been too big for the room it's in.I've used it with my Toshiba HD DVD player, my Xbox 360, as well as my PS3 for Blu-Ray movies and games. Everything looks amazing, especially once you get some good custom picture settings going.My only complaint (and what keeps this from getting 5 stars) are the speakers. Compared to my 32" model they sound very hollow and tinny. But I think I've found a setting I can live with, or I'm just getting used to it.Overall, if you can get this from Amazon and not one of their secondary sellers I highly recommend it. They have the best price and free shipping. The delivery guy was extremely nice and helped carry the TV in. The box had no damage whatsoever on it. Couldn't be more pleased with this service.

Our PN60F8500 is fantastic. Bright, beautiful, realistic colors and deep black. All three of my coumputer monitors are Samsung and we have a Samsung LED TV. Samsung displays are the best!

review_title: Hard to beat
review_text: There are a number of already very detailed and well written reviews here on this HDTV and since it's out of production now I won't add to them except to say they are very accurate. We bought ours towards the end of this models run and for the deal we got (which meant getting a 52" instead of a 46" for the same price or actually less) I couldn't see a better 1080p 60 Hz HDTV out there. I studied the 65 against the 120Hz 71 model and the Sony Bravias and there was absolutely nothing that could justify the extra money except that the bezels on this era and model of Samsungs left a bit to be desired compared to the Bravia as far as quality. The newer 550, 650 and 750 series Samsungs have in my opinion much improved bezels. However, that rather cheap plastic black bezel isn't what you watch and unless I pay a lot of attention to it it's really hard to find anything wrong. It's operated flawlessly since removed from the box and set up. If you are happy with something that doesn't have quite all the bells and whistles of the newer Samsung replacements and at the much cheaper price these are bringing now I wouldn't pass it up however they're getting difficult to find now.

review_title: LUV IT!
review_text: I now own my Samsung LN-S4095D for about 6 weeks and so far have been extremely happy with the product. The picture quality is more than acceptable in non HD programming. The HD programming will blow you away. You can see the pores in peoples skin and the tiny little sparkle in their eyes. Its great! I don't know why some say the internal surround sound speakers are tinny sounding. I have found that with proper adjustments on the audio menu, you can get a very acceptable sound from the internal speakers. Make no mistake, my Bose surround system which is an add on sound much better than the internal speakers, but for average broadcasting the internal sound is very acceptable to my listening tastes. If you prefer more dramatic audio, invest in a Bose Surround system, expecially for watching a movie.Menu adjustments are pretty easy to understand and simple to make minor changes to your individual tastes following very understandable menu items. I am still getting after 6 weeks an odor of heated plastic from I guess the newness of the TV. At least I think that's what the odor is from. top and back of the screen seems to get pretty warm to the touch while the system is on. I thind that's pretty common. Overall, I would highly recommend this flat screen HD to anyone looking for a good buy and a quality HD LCD TV.

review_title: The Best TV for the $$$
review_text: I bought this TV in Early March and have had it for about 2 months. I have been 110% happy with it. This is my first HDTV so I was careful about which one to buy. I use almost every input on the tv. I have my Xbox 360 and PS3 and HD cable box hooked up via HDMI. Some of you may think how i have 3 HDMI sources hooked into two on the TV, my sound system has a splitter built in. I have my computer hooked up via VGA though I have stoped using it because 1080p is such high eez the text although clear was small from 8 ft away. I have my Wii DVD player hooked up via component. I do own the HD dvd add on for my Xbox 360 and it is amazing picture quality. I also have Blu-ray as it is built in to the PS3. In my opinion the HD DVD looks better as it uses VC-1 for most of its movies. While Ble-ray uses some unfinished Java and there for in some scenes there is a grainy look. It has gotten much better with newer movies such as Night at the Museum. I always buy a movie on HD DVD if I can. Now back to the TV, SD is okay but i don't really watch it other than Daily Show & Colbert Report. HD looks stunning and UI have no complain on the black levels. 6000:1 is great although 10000:1 is what I would have liked but is too expensive on an LCD. The Piano finish looks great and classy. I can not watch anything with the built in speakers as I am used to a 5.1 system and recommend getting something for audio. Games look great in HD but the Wii is not meant for any HD let alone a 1080p TV. Does not really matter i hardly use it as it is. The 360 doubles as an up-convert DVD player. I just watched Lost season one and two as well as the first season of Rome on DVD and it looked amazing on this HDTV, you may even think of them as HD releases.I am totally happy with this HDTV in more ways than I can count. I highly recommend it and believe it is the best 1080p 40" TV on the market as of writing.

review_title: Very good - fully satisfied.
review_text: This is my first Flat panel TV , I think I have made right choice buying it from Amazon. brought it at Christmas season and got it delivered on time. TV was in warehouse for 2 days & had to call eagle to make delivery appointment but they were so nice and delivered on week end so that I will be home. amazon reduced price by 140$ 2 days after my purchase and they happily refunded me that money.love everything about this TV but 2 complaints 1.flashy glass screen is little distracting 2. viewing from side angle ( more than 150 degrees ) screen appears little lighter, I though LCD are supposed to look at same quality at any angle. and also I see little bit of window reflection as we commonly see in Plasma tv.overall I love the TV (with my Dish HD connection ), the problem with Dish is that right now they only telecasting 1080i not 1080 p.. we may have to wait for little longer to see 1080p programming. i guess the best way to enjoy this TV is watching a HD DVD through HD or Blue ray player.by the way I have made some changes to the setting suggested by first reviewer and it looked even better after changes - thanks to him.

review_title: Glad we waited and went with this TV; superb picture and very easy to use for non-techies
review_text: We traded in our 1996 35" CRT for this TV. Not only is the picture fantastic, the Anynet HDMI control makes it very, very easy to use. Turn on the TV and the surround sound system turns itself on, uses the Audio Return Channel feature for sound, turns off the TV internal speakers and sets itself up. The TV remote volume now controls the surround sound system without having to put in any codes or punch any extra buttons; it just works. Put a DVD into my PS3 and the TV automatically switches to the appropriate input and displays the DVD. And the TV remote now controls the PS3 without having to input any codes or punch any extra buttons; it just works. The TV was extremely easy to set up with our cable TV DVR and the TV remote runs it fine. A few things that would make it nicer is that the TV remote turns the cable box off when the TV turns off but will not turn the cable box on when the TV is turned on. There is a button on the TV remote to turn on the cable box but it caused my wife some frustration because she knew she had not turned it off. It would be nice if the STB (set-top box) turned on when the TV turns on, just like it turns off when the TV turns off. Or just leave the STB on as our old TV did. Also, the Guide button on the touch remote always starts at Channel 2 regardless of what channel you're watching. You have to go through several moves on the touch remote to get to the "STB Guide" (set-top box). There should be an option to allow the Guide button on the touch remote to default to the STB Guide. We use Skype with our kids away at college. The camera and microphone work great from a distance of about eighteen feet away. The built-in apps for Netflix and Amazon Instant Video work well. All in all, we are EXTREMELY pleased with this TV, its integration and performance. Job well done, Samsung!

review_text: I have been looking at TVs for over a year and finally reached a decision and bought this TV. I just love it, no problems. My only worry was spending so much money online but after this experience why would anyone shop any other way. Buying though Amazon was easy and the best part was no tax, no shipping costs and the product was delivered to my home and placed on my TV stand, (white glove) also all packing material was hauled off. Buying from a 'brick and mortar' store means I have to pay tax and get a truck and haul the thing myself to my home,forget that. A day after I bought it the price came down 250. I called and they said that they would give me the lower price, and if it came down more within the month they would give me that price also,,can't beat that.. I am totally pleased which rare now-a-days.

review_title: THE BEST LCD ON THE MARKET
review_text: I can not going to say much because the other reviews pretty much sum it up. This is by far the best LCD TV on the market and look as good or better than all the plasmas I have seen. The glossy is screen is definitely what makes the difference. I have read CNET reviews that have criticized the screen but the reviews are rediculous. This screen is comparable to any plasma screen in tern of reflection issues and the picture is produces is better than any other LCD on the market. BUY THIS TV, IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.In addition to the great picture, it is loaded with tons of other features. This is my first Samsung and based on this, it won't be my last.

review_title: Our Third Samsung
review_text: We have three Samsung TV's a 46", a 60" Smart TV and bought the 40" Smart TV for our Granddaughter when she visits. Have to say picture on all three is good, however, the 40" picture seems to be the best pic of the three. I have a hearing problem and don't always hear sounds well, but I do think that I hear the sound better on the 40". The Smart TV on the 40" is set up different than the 60" and I am not too familar with it yet but we think that the technology is better than our 60" and it is only 15 months old. We are all pleased with the 40" Smart TV and it looks good hanging on the wall of a small room; my husband found it easy to hang and to connect to cable. We really like Samsung products so far and would buy again.

review_title: Great TV!
review_text: We've had it now for about a month, and it's working beautifully! The picture is bright and clear - we all just want more HD stations to view now. Some friends kept telling us that we wouldn't be happy if our TV wasn't LCD or plasma, but so far this one proves them wrong. We wanted a larger TV for a better price, and got it. We had no problems with the delivery, as I know a few others did. Ours is in a basement corner, so we don't notice any viewing angle distortion or glare unless we're almost directly to the immediate left or right of the TV. Consumers report mentioned it having a problem with the rainbow effect, but none of us have ever noticed anything. It is a better TV for a big room (ours was 18 by 20 ft) - if you're too close, it does bother your eyes. I did get an extended warranty on it just to be safe because I'm not sure how the led engine light system will hold up over time. I was able to extend the warranty 3 more years through visa for a much better price than the company. If you're in the market for a big TV, and don't want to pay $6000, I'd say go for it!

review_title: Great TV especially for movies
review_text: After some serious research I purchased this television. When it comes to playing movies I am amazed at the clarity and picture definition. With the new Sony wireless sound system, the house shakes. I do wish the transmission was better with the area cable company. With a HDTV antennae I can pick up the local channels broadcast in HD. This is also a fantastic picture. I was afraid from another review that the piano black bezel would be a problem. I don't even notice it. Every night at home with my wife is now movie night. Stereo VHS? Still a better picture and sound than I could have imagined.

review_title: Great TV and outstanding response when repair was necessary
review_text: I purchased this TV because of the many reviews noting excellent picture quality and competitive price. I was not disappointed. Additionally Amazon's delivery service was excellent. After 2 years and well beyond the expiration of the warranty period the TV began to show signs of failure. Before it was 3 years old it did fail. Under these circumstances a five star rating may be overly generous but Samsung's response was very impressive. I used an email link from their web site to describe my problem and simply ask if they ever covered the cost of repairs for out of warranty problems. That was a Saturday night. By Sunday morning there was a response - Samsung was arranging for a local repair service to contact me and by Wednesday in-home service was completed at no cost to me. I can't imagine a better response and I particularly appreciated Samsung's honesty in the reply to my email: "We are getting many complaints from customers that their LCD TV just keeps clicking and won't turn on, OR it is taking more time to turn on." I would have expected a much slicker response that didn't so openly admit to a problem. Bravo Samsung - such honesty is rare.

review_title: Great TV...1080p is AMAZING
review_text: I've had this TV for a week ... ordered it from Amazon, got it in about 5 days, and I love it. The PQ rivals expensive Sony sets, and I much prefer the look of these to those other brands. The only "issue" I have with the TV is the lack of overscan control over HDMI ... when using the PC over HDMI, it clips an inch or so around the border, making it difficult to recover maximized windows or even use the Start bar. There is probably a firmware update available for this, and if so, I would definitely give this thing 5 stars. There is no overscan over VGA though, so I can live with an analog PC connection for now. Chances are, if you do even a little research, you'll conclude that this set is the best bang for the buck.

review_title: Great picture quality but it has many defects.... eventually went to Sony
review_text: This is what I wrote in my previous review:Bought my Samsung HL-T6187S on 9/23/2007. I was hesitant with buying such a big size and ticket item online. However, Amazon was great, for both delivery, punctuality, and price. I came from a 15 year old 32" CRT TV so this was my treat. What can I say, I hold on to my stuff until they are sooooo obsolete or broken. Eagle was great for delivering the product unscathed. Turned on the TV and my eyes were as giddy as a school boy. The picture was great. Over the Hedge and Star Wars 1080p looked sooooo wonderful. Even the built in TV speakers with SRS turned on is pretty good, for built in TV speakers. Wonderful array of inputs and outputs. It was surprisingly light. The cabinets do feel a slightly flimsy.But, hey, I guess this is what I get for getting technology not fully matured. I too got the halo prism and this ))))))))(((((((( effect. Also one dead pixel. Let me expand.I have one dead black pixel. I understand that is inherent in the manufacturing process. Much like LCD monitors. It even says so in the Warranty disclaimer. No biggie because I have to be watching a bright white scene and be at less than a foot from the screen and really look for it. At 8 feet or more you cannot see it. Ho humm. I still say the disclaimer that a consumer must accept a few dead pixels due to manufacturing limitations and cannot return the product is unacceptable. The consumer must accept a less than perfect product but good enough is unacceptable. I guess I along with the masses have accepted this. Luckily, I still love Samsung and I got their SyncMaster(tm) 226BW 22" widescreen display with no flaws. Lovely product. That's why I'm sticking with Samsung. Great prices for a great product.So on the ))))))))(((((((( effect. Like the dead pixel I have to be actually less than 6", viewing a bright white background, and at an extreme side angle to see it. At the suggested greater than 8 feet viewing distance this is not noticeable. No problem with that.The biggest complaint I have is the halo prism defect. This is easily producible like the other posters indicated. The senate scene in 300. Where you have the white sky and pillar background and Queen Gorgo is standing and providing a dark foreground. It can also be easily produced via a PC. Put a dark screen in the bottom half with the rest of the screen white. I did it by having an MS-DOS screen in the bottom center half with Windows Explorer in the background.I'm calling Samsung to get this fixed.So after being pulled around by the Samsung techs I'm on my second TV. Thankfully, Amazon is such a a great online company that the exchange was no hassle and I went without a TV uninterrupted.Well, this second set still had the halo prism problem but less intense. No dead pixels. However, the screen looked like it had dust behind the screen. Now this one has a geometry problem on the top. the ))))(((( is actually more intense now. On top of that, the screen doesn't seem to be securely attached to the screen!!! Samsung needs to get their manufacturing act together. Second tech call!Update on 11/28/2007...After the second set had the same problems but more defects, I jumped ship and bought a Sony KDS-60A3000. Very nice TV.

review_title: What the hell is Samsung selling here?
review_text: I am so fed up with this tv. We have had it for just a little over 2 years now. When you turn it on it comes on for about 3 seconds and then the picture goes out! We have had a repair man out and he tried to diagnose with no sucess. He brought it to his shop and after numerous tests he couldn't come up with a reason for this.He mentioned that it could be the panel but that seems to be the response when all else fails? Of course the panel cost as much as a new one! The repairman who talks up Samsung thought maybe we just got a bad one and that does happen. But after reading these reviews I have to think that Samsung is crap! Customer service is crap, quality is crap and it isn't with just a few tvs! The more I look at Samsung reviews and my own experience has me wanting to scream to everyone who will listen: STAY AWAY FROM SAMSUNG! Does anyone remember the old days when we laughed at Samsung? I don't know how they where able to get their ratings up, except for that they threw a ton of money into everything but quality and reliblity.

review_title: I could not be more pleased!
review_text: The Samsung replaced a five year old 55" rear projection Mitsubishi, and the picture quality is stunning! HD-DVD and even standard DVDs look better than I have ever experienced! I almost want to sit and watch movies all day, but don't have the time for it.Although I have a receiver that handles all of my HDMI and component switching, this TV also has a multitude of inputs which I used to help me get going.With the unit being reasonably shallow and light, it does not fill up my entire livingroom. I was able to rearrange my furniture so much of the stuff is now behind the TV.The experience with Amazon and the delivery people (EGL) has also been a good one. When you consider the hundreds of dollars in savings over retail and the painless delivery, it was an easy choice for me.

review_title: THE BEST SELECTION POSSIBLE AFTER CAREFUL REVIEW
review_text: My husband and I couldn't be more satisfied--we have absolutely enjoyed our new Samsung LED TV from day one. The only negative factor was the delivery people--we were told that they would take the television out of the box for us to check for any problem--THEY REFUSED TO REMOVE THE PRODUCT FROM THE BOX--MY HUSBAND HAD TO DO IT--BUT HE WOULDN'T LET THEM LEAVE UNTIL HE DID EXACTLY THAT.--I feel like it is the delivery companys issue. We have personally been very pleased with Amazon service, people we talked to and the product itself--FANTASTIC TELEVISION--BRILLIANT COLOR--WE HAVE A MOVIE CINEMA SET UP IN OUR DEN WITH OUR NEW TELEVISION. We have never done business prior to this with Amazon--always a little nervous whether to order on line. Very pleased with the service--would not hesitate to do business with Amazon again. Our daughter also ordered from Amazon a blue ray by Samsung for us as a gift. It is a compliment to our new television.The color is brilliant--I personally think it looks even better than the Plasma tvs--I am so glad I waited until these new models came out...The best price for the best TV and really happy with it!!!!!!!!!!!

review_title: Wide Fit ?
review_text: I bought the Samsung LNT5265F when it first came out in May or June of 2007 for the insane price of $4600 from Sears. The TV was brand new and it was one of the first LCD's to have 1080p technology. I also bought a $500 warranty from Sears to increase the warranty to 2012. The price dropped more then $2500 with in 6 months of my purchase. As of 3/2010 I realized I can no longer wide fit any station or channel unless it is in HD and already broadcasting in this format. Prior to this I was able to make any movie or station fit the screen. When Sears came out to look at the TV they decided it maybe a software problem they checked it and said the software I have is the latest version. The software by the way is dated Oct 07. They then decided to switch out the main board in the TV. Unfortunately this did absolutely nothing. They are now trying to tell me that my TV was never able to wide fit stations or movies that aren't broadcasting in that format. The TV has an option that says Wide fit which I've used successfully for almost 3 years. Now the option while still there no longer lights up or allows you to click on it. Anyone else have this problem or was my TV magical and operating above and beyond the capabilities intended by Samsung?

review_title: Incredible TV for the money
review_text: Let me first start by saying that before this TV I had a 23" Sanyo HDTV. The size difference is incredible (when I first got the TV it was so much clearer and bigger that I actually got a sense of being dizzy while playing FPS's on it). The display is very very crisp and clear. I can honestly say this is one of the best looking displays I have ever seen. The new screens that Samsung is using in their LCD HDTVs is a great improvement (it has a slightly glossier look to it than conventional LCD's, giving it a cleaner and brighter look, without being too shiny like some Plasmas can be). The only negative I can think of for this TV is that it took a while to get the settings just right to get the best image. But once you do it really is the best image you can get for the price. Samsung is known for being top quality on their HDTVs, and this one is no exception. I can honestly say I would most definately recommend this set to anyone who is looking at TVs in this size/price range.

review_title: Two for Two
review_text: I was told we were buying the latest and greatest technology at the time of our purchase of our first Samsung 61DLP. The picture was great and for the first couple of years all was well. During that time and based on the excellent picture and no problems occuring we purchase a second 61DLP for our downstairs game room. Not long after the second purchase the lamp in the first set went out. I called support and was told the lamp was not covered in the warranty, so we spent $179.00 and installed it ourselves. All went well for another 2 plus years then the set went out again. This time a technician came to the house and informed us that the "engine" needed to be replaced. Luckily we had bought the extended 5 year warranty (for $450) and we were still in the warranty period (by 2 months). He replaced the engine with a rebuilt one, can you believe it after spending $450 on a warrantywe got a rebuilt part. But it worked and we were happy again. Only one year later the set went out again and after buying another lamp (which we could not return) we were told by the Samsung technician it wasn't the lamp and the TV for all prctical purposes was dead. My upset is with the fact I spent $4,971.91 for the latest technological set and only got 6 years use out of it, a cost of over $800 per year. But we had the second set and moved it into our living room about 6 months ago. It has seen little use in the game room and had very few hours on it. I thought we would be good for another few years. Nope, today the lamp popped and the tv quit. Is it only the lamp? or is it something else? who knows, we will have to call the Samsung tech people and start all over again. Or we just may scrap the set and go buy a GOOD tv, anyone help us on that one. Two Samsung 61DLP's $7,000 invested and no tv to watch. Never Again!

review_title: Oh my heavens
review_text: Let me first start by saying this tv is an upgrade from my 13inch aiwa, I just bought a new condo and decided to get a good tv. And man is it!I work for a major cable company, and hooked this bad boy up to my hd dvr, through hdmi, and the picture looks crystal clear! but what i was most amazed at is how good regular television looks as well, this tv does a good job of smothing out the artifacts of standard television. But by far the absolute best use of this tv, is the fact that it is a computer monitor as well. Sitting on my couch with a wireless keyboard and mouse and browsing the internet is awsome. The last thing i have to say about this tv is that it does well in day light, I remember my grandparents used to have an old projection tv back in the day and if there was any light in the room the tv would be completely faded. Not with this tv, i can watch it perfect with my living room blinds open and it looks as good as it does with them closed. This is an excelent tv which blows away any other competition in its price range.

review_title: Great value, great quality, great picture!
review_text: Bought this about 30-days ago and I have been very very pleased.I watched for this model to go down in price and when it slid far enough I grabbed it up. Excellent picture, exceptable sound, slow response time on remote. More contrast than one could ever want. I have a full open living room with lots of windows. No problem watching in mid-day. Amazon's white glove delivery was great, delivered on time and unpacked and even hooked up. I'll buy again from Amazon for that kind of service.

review_title: Still completely satisfied...Welcome to Full HD!
review_text: Purchased back in August. No problems with delivery. Continued to get price refunds from Amazon till the 30 days were up (price very close to current price). PS3 is hooked up with HDMI! Blu-Ray; "Cars" just say WOW!!! Regular DVD's look really good. Just picking up HD broadcasts for free. NFL on FOX 720p, NBC 1080i & CBS 1080i Look fantastic! Music award shows make you feel like you are in the front row. This set gives you the signal that you put into it. Feed it quality HD programming and you won't be let down. Optical audio output into stereo provides Dolby Digital surround if available from the broadcast! 40" size gives an awesome tight picture in a smaller living room like ours.-Only cons I can think of...I have one stuck pixel in the lower right, not bad out of 2,073,600 (can't tell it's there unless you walk up and look for it). Remote is a little weak, have to aim at TV. Blacks could be a tad darker, only can tell in very dark movie scenes...but not at this price!Best home electronics purchase I've ever made.

review_title: Broken out of the box
review_text: The TV was delivered in a hurry, not the so-called "white glove" that it is made out to be. The TV was "broken" out of the box - it had sound but no picture. It was later determined, after many tries, by the Samsung Technical Support that it needed to be returned.We were charged for $42 for return by Amazon for no fault of our own.

review_title: Fantastic TV w/ awesome PQ
review_text: Pros:Lots of options/settings when it comes to picture quality. Tons of inputs. 3 HMDI v1.3, 2 component, 2 composite, 1 VGA, 1 S-video, OTA and coax hookups. The HDMI, VGA, and component are compatible at 1080p with the tv. The picture itself is amazing. With all the tvs I physically looked at, this one just looked the best to me. Blacks look black, not grey. Aesthically it looks amazing too. Black finish along the tv, with the speakers hidden. I thought the sound quality, given where the speakers are located and the size of them, was exceptional (for factory tv speakers). No handshake or banding issues. No dead pixles. There are lots of options with size. I love how the tv auto syncs with other samsung equipment, allowing the use of just the tv control for everything. Have it connected to a 1080P samsung upconverter which works well.Cons:When using HDMI/DVI cable from my PC to the tv about once every 2 hours i will get a very quick pink or green flash. For some reason it is only from the PC, never from any other source, and does not happen when PC runs thru the VGA. I was disappointed with the PIP function. You can only watch TV (or any source run thru the coax) with PIP. IE, if your playing a PC game, u can watch TV. But you cant play a game and watch your DVD player thru PIP (dont know if this is consistent with other tvs thou, but I wish this one did). No ghosting with this tv, but on fast moving close ups you can see some pixilation. IE while watching a bball game, player makes a shot, camera zooms on his face as he runs down the court. Only time ever noticed this.note: Eagle GL shipped my package. Package looked like it was handled properly, and they called me on time to deliver the package. However, i elected to pick it up Friday instead of having them deliver it Monday (they dont do weekends, dont ask me why). I was not very impressed with them when picking up the package. The lady at the desk did not even know how to let me sign for it! But package was unharmed, free dilvery by amazon.Other notes:4065 has a glass finish on it, which makes colors more vibrant and more realistic. However, for some people it may cause glare. I have had no glares problems when using proper lighting. One note with pixilation, happens on all LCDs. I have only noticed it a few times, on closeups on fast moving objects. One reason why I chose this tv, over the 4665 or any larger LCD, is the pixilation and ghosting become more apparent on larger screens with the same refresh rate. But like I said, practically none on this one and its smaller size of 40".Conclusion:Overall, a TV needs to have great Picture Quality, and this one has the best I have seen with tvs 40" and up.

review_title: Very pleased with Amazon
review_text: I just had this LCD delivered tonight and wanted to share my experience with ordering through Amazon. I was nervous about buying such an expensive LCD online, but I am very happy. The TV was shipped and delivered exactly when Amazon promised. The freight shipping company was Eagle USA; I read multiple posts on AVS forum commenting that this was a good company and I have to agree. I tracked the order online and it showed it arrived in my city Friday morning. By early Friday afternoon they called to schedule a delivery time. They showed up during the four hour delivery window as promised, brought the TV to my unit, helped me unpack it and allowed me to hook it up to my cable box to make sure it worked before I signed for it. Overall, I could not have asked for better service from either Amazon or Eagle USA, and am glad I chose to purchase through the site at a savings of almost $1,000.As for the TV, the HD picture quality is AMAZING! I've only watched it for a few hours now so won't comment in too much depth, but so far I've experienced no problems with the TV.I love this TV and am very happy I decided to finally make the purchase!

review_title: A Great LCD HDTV with a few minor issues...
review_text: I purchased the Samsung LN-T5265F LCD HDTV recently, price was great through Amazon, no other B&M; stores could come close to their price.Pros:-Black is superb, which was the #1 Most impressive thing about this TV-Color is great, takes some calibration from the default settings though-Lots of inputs 3xHDMI, VGA (PC) etc....-Contrast is amazing, its absolutely stunning to see something white on a black background.Cons:-Left & Right sides of the TV are brighter (not clouds, but brighter pillars) but it is not consistent, only some content makes it noticeable. Dark movies through HDMI on my PC it was very noticeable, but on HDMI HD-DVR it's not as noticible.-Slow input change, switching between HDMI inputs was slow, and there is no direct input buttons on the remote.-Unit makes some "creaking" clicks/noises when you turn it on and off for about a min or two, (ie. like your car when its cooling off) it's not very loud, and doesn't bother me that much.Anyway, it's a fantastic LCD HDTV. Every time I sit down to watch it I marvel and how great the contrast and the colors are. Also using my PC @ 1080p (1920x1080) resolution is amazingly clear!This is a great TV, that I would recommend to almost anyone, except those that are very picky like me about the very faint brighter left/right sides of the screen (only in certain conditions).I have also returned this TV due to the fact that I can't stand the brighter left/right sides, I couldn't live with this. I have since purchased a LN-T5271f, which doesn't have this issue and is well worth the extra 4-5 hundred extra for the advanced features and even better contrast.

review_title: Awesome !!
review_text: I bought for my son's room, it's a nice small size, fits on a small desk nicely. This TV does it all. Works great as a PC display, great for gaming, and the digital TV tuner pulls in all the over the air channels A-OK. As a bonus, you can plug in a USB flash drive and play music / videos / photos with common PC files - no fancy conversion required like with Apple products. The only con is the the TV stand, it provides no tilt support which would be nice when using as a PC display. There are some display settings that can be used to compensate for no tilt, but a nicer stand would be better. There is mounting support (4 screw holes) on the back, so I'm considering attaching it to the wall with a bracket with tilt support.

review_title: mine is a lemon
review_text: When the tv was working, I generally liked it purely because of its size and price. Getting a good brightness and color setting for the screen is challenging. There is a very narrow range of view angles for optimal quality - directly in front of the screen and near eye-level. Otherwise, the picture is dim. It's frustrating to see such a big difference just from standing versus sitting in the same spot. I haven't had any other DLPs to compare this to.I can't comment on HD. SD is acceptable for normal programming, although I'm sure HD would look snazzy. Sports can be frustrating to watch at this size in SD, though.The #1 problem with mine is that the volume spontaneously goes all the way up to 100, and unplugging the set for several minutes is the only solution. This happened within an hour of getting it off the truck, but then didn't happen again for maybe a month. After it had happened a few times, I called Samsung for repairs. After 2.5 weeks in the shop, it just came back today - worse than before. I had it on for ~15 minutes at a time, then the volume cranked up and it had to be unplugged for several minutes. So for now, its only use is as a big expensive digital photo viewer.It's probably a bad sign that while this tv was in the shop for two and a half weeks, I really didn't miss it.

review_title: My third TV
review_text: This is the one I bought after trying three. Two things could be better: when I set it up it didn't seem to work. The directions for using this TV with a satellite dish are in need of a rewrite. I finally asked for info about how to have it picked up again by the shipper but about that time I stumbled onto setting it on Video 3 to get a picture. So don't dispair.The other thing that could be better are the sound controls. Eventually I will connect it to the external sound system to get more treble. Treble is what we need to listen to spoken words and to the Brits in particular. Otherwise, I love it!

review_title: Excellent apart from one issue
review_text: I've had this TV for nearly a year. It's excellent with 1080i signal via HDMI from an upscaling DVD player. The picture is beautiful, the sound is not bad, especially for such a compact design (the speaker is beneath the screen). Compared to the competition at the time we bought this the value was absolutely superb. I also run 1080i signals via HDMI from my AppleTV box, and that also works great.The one problem I have just run into is when playing back 1080p signals from my new PS3 via HDMI, the picture eventually cuts out, and then the TV will pretty much refuse to display anything from the game console.I exchanged my PS3 under warranty and it made no difference. I don't know if this is a one-off problem with my unit, or if it's a design flaw. I've been unable to find any reports of this, hence my motivation for posting. I'm going to try the PS3 using a component video cable instead. If that works then I'll be satisfied (the difference between 1080i and 1080p will not be a dealbreaker for me on a 40" TV, it might be more significant on the larger models).

review_title: You get what you pay for!
review_text: The phrase "You get what you pay for" is a definite fact when it comes to HDTV's and Samsung definitely delivers. Probably the best picture quality of any LCD tv on the market and the sleek styling to look good in any living room. The only knock on it that I have is I would like to have another HDMI input but only one other tv on the market has the extra HDMI input. All around the best tv you can buy right now!

review_title: Great TV at great price
review_text: I got my Samsung a couple weeks ago and it's been great. Just watched Apocalypto and Music & Lyrics and the picture was stunning using just a S-video cable. It just takes a little dialing in of the features to make it look great. I bought some HDMI cables online, but I don't see how the picture could be any better. I swear, some of the scenes in Music & Lyrics almost had a 3d aspect to them. I wound up paying over $600 less from Amazon (not to mention taxes and delivery) than I would have at Best Buy or Circuit City. I was a little leery about buying something like this from Amazon, but they really came through with fast, safe delivery and of course, the price. Now all I have to do is get HD service from my cable company and I'm all set!

review_title: BE CAREFUL with REFURBISHED items!
review_text: Product is being returned! I had great delivery service even though it was delayed at the beginning. It was suppose to be a refurbished LCD but looked used when it got here. There were two issues with it: (1) a horizontal gray area about 8-10" wide in the middle of the LCD and (2) sometimes the LCD would not turn on (but you can hear movie though). There were also issues with the colors - green and red. I had to constantly adjust the colors. With this experience, I decided to stay away from LCDs until the technology matures for larger screens. Seems like all bad LCD stories happen with the larger screens. So, I went and bought a 50" Panasonic plasma instead.

review_title: Definitely satisfied
review_text: The reviews I read here on Amazon really helped persuade me to buy this. I can say it lived up to my expectations.PROS: Like everybody else here says, HD TV shows are amazing. Xbox 360 looks great--I've really enjoyed playing games on it like Gears of War and Halo 3. Regular DVDs look fantastic (I don't have a HD DVD player yet).I like that I can plug in a USB memory stick or a MP3 player through the USB port and view pics or play music.Menu system is straightforward. I've left the picture settings on default. I like the richness of colors in Dynamic mode (default). Movie mode washes them out. I also like that you can label the inputs so when you switch sources the label that appears on screen is more descriptive.I like how the cable ports are off to the side instead of in the center of the back--this made it easier to hook up.CONS: Sound is ok for watching TV shows, but nothing special. I wish it didn't display MUTE when I mute it though, since I prefer to mute the TV when I turn on my surround sound speakers. I get an echo if I have both on and the volume is above ~20.Viewing angle isn't as wide as LCDs, but this is common for DLPs. The viewing angle isn't bad enough for it to be a problem for me.Standard Def is disappointing, but I haven't compared it to standard def on other HDTVs from my provider, so I can't give a truly qualified opinion on that.Why I chose this: strength of reviews, 1080p, price per inch vs LCD, new model, LED has longer life, it fit on my existing TV stand

review_title: Best TV I ever bought
review_text: I bought this television new back on 3/20/07. I was finishing my basement and needed something big enough to fill the space yet light enough to get down a steep flight of stairs. At the time I had a 57" Toshiba RPTV that while a great tv, was to heavy and awkward to get down the stairs. So I sold it and bought the Samsung.Delivery was amazing. I think it was originally slated to take 12-14 days, I got a call 3 days after I ordered it from the shipping company saying they had it, would be in the area, and did I want it early? I was amazed that not only was delivery free, it only took 3 days.As for the TV set, blown away would be the best word to use. While I don't have an HD-DVD or Blu-Ray player (yet) it made my progressive scan DVD player show a movie like never before. The first movie we watched was the new James Bond flick and after the opening chase scene, I told my fiance that I don't think I'll ever go into a movie theater again, I was that impressed. Since that day, I've hooked up my PS2 game system as well as my PC. It is great to have a TV that everyone can enjoy, as well as the option for a 61" PC monitor for online gaming, web surfing and working from home.If you are on the fence about buying this TV, don't wait, just do it. You will not regret this purchase.

review_title: Fantastic value & design
review_text: I work for a TV station, so I have an eye for this sort of stuff, and I'm up on the technology. The LED-backlits are certainly bright and have potential, but if you're looking for the best of the trusted, previous generation - this Samsung is the TV for you. Forget the overpriced Sony...This TV produces an excellent picture quality in a streamlined, modern design, at the all-important 1080p resolution, for a very affordable price. If you're willing to give up wall-mounting for screen size (and to me, the more real estate on an HDTV, the better) then this is a great buy. The piano black finish goes well in almost any home theater setting (mine is paired with a Bush gloss black & tinted glass stand) and the very thin bezel along the edge of the screen makes it seem like all you see is the image. The TV is deceptively small. It looks smaller than other 61" TV's when it's off b/c it doesn't have the extra plastic sticking off the sides like many competitors' TVs. But once you turn it on, it impresses.Amazon did a great job of getting me the TV. It came faster than the delivery date said it would be here, and two guys carried it up to the 4th floor of my building. I asked them not to unpack it, but they would have. I did have a problem with the unit (a dog whistle type, high-pitched hum). I called Samsung and had a great experience with customer service reps (how often do you hear that?!) The repair guy fixed the problem, all for free, and came at a late time b/c I work well past 5pm. The problem was a bad power supply unit, btw... and it's worked marvelously since then.Don't worry about the time it takes to warm up. It comes on fairly quick, and then slowly gets brighter until it reaches its full brightness. The repair guy showed me how easy it is to replace a lamp if need be (because it's a DLP it's likely) and a monkey with a screwdriver could do it...Overall recommendation: BUY

review_title: Samsung DLP = Best Quality for your Large Screen HDTV Dollar
review_text: I've been planning on purchasing a large screen HDTV for at least two years now and with the recent price cuts in HDTVs I decided to take the plunge. I started off by researching the competing technologies and specifications that define HDTV. Next, I moved on to visiting local retailers to see how HDTVs from different manufacturers compared to each other. I primarily kept my eye on Samsung, Sony, JVC, and Mitsubishi. I looked at Sony due to their reputation for high quality displays (WEGA, XBR). Mitsubishi was investigated because one of my friends who owns a Mitsubishi HDTV. JVC was looked at primarily because the price points and features closely matched Samsung's. The Samsung had the best picture of all units I viewed at the local retailers. Amazon won my hard earned dollars due to their excellent Super Saver shipping and their price point which was more than $300 less than the lowest price offered by a local retailer. Factor in local taxes, and delivery charges and my savings mounted to more than $500.The Samsung picture is stunning. Standard DVDs look very good in 4:3 mode or if they are properly formatted for widescreen, 16:9 mode. The TV has a wealth of customization features that allow tailoring of tint be each of the primary colors plus two additional colors in their 5-color gamut. Presets for different color styles simplify changing the color temperatures. A static high-quality, color rich image is present in the setup screen to view existing settings side by side with changes applied. Additonally, Samsung has viewing themes (e.g. Standard, Movie, Vivid) that changing color, contrast, and brightness characteristics. Lastly, Samsung includes a feature called DNIe that appplies a high-quality sharpening filter to the picture. The feature does as promised but can definitely reveal limitations in the image source that would have been missed with the feature disabled. You can preview DNIe via a split screen that shows the picture with and without the DNIe applied. I have not used the built-in audio capabilities of the TV so I cannot comment on the audio quality.The Samsung chassis is very elegant and the screen bezel is a piano-lacquer black. The unit only weighs approx. 80 lbs. and has a surprisingly small footprint.Shipping for me was handled by EGL out of Ohio. The unit arrived well ahead of time and the delivery quality was mediocre. The delivery truck arrived with only one employee and I had to assist him with bringing the unit into the house. I made the deliveryperson wait as the unit was unboxed and had him assist me with placing the TV on its stand. I then powered the unit and verified that the picture was uniform across all parts of the screen and that there were no scratches or other physical flaws to the plastic screen. All was well.I've now has the TV for three days and am pleased with its features and quality. I would recommend Samsung HDTVs and Amazon to anyone.

review_title: After two years...
review_text: After two years, this LED DLP 50" display still has a better image than any LCD I've seen. I only wish I had purchased the 67" model when they were still available. Samsung should not have discontinued their DLP line of HDTVs. I guess most consumers want a display they can hang on their wall. I use this as a monitor for Blu-ray, HD DVD and a computer, all connected to HDMI ports on my Yamaha receiver. I've never used the audio built into the television and never watch television. It's ideal for my uses and I've never seen a display that gives such a film-like reproduction of HD movies. I hope it lasts another 2 years since nothing out there matches it yet.

review_title: My review - less than 2 yrs later
review_text: Let the fun begin. I bought this TV May12, 2007 and the extended warranty thru Amazon. The TV is now beginning to fail (Feb 2009). When I turn it on, it tries to turn on, then turns off, then turns on, etc. and when a picture finally appears, I can see whatever program is on but there are also little pink dots all over the screen. If I turn the TV off, and turn it back on, it comes on without recycling on and off like it does initially, and the little pink dots are gone. Today the pink dots were replaced by a solid screen of colored lines. Turned the TV off and on again and got a good picture. When I bought the TV from Amazon, I also bought the extended 4yr warranty. I called N.e.w. today and a service rep is coming next week. I paid a lot of money for this TV in 2007. The new model of Samsung that is comparable to this TV is now only $900 give or take. I paid $1800. So hopefully, this will turn out well and the extended service contract will prove to be worthwhile. I plan on re-reviewing along my journey.Followup: The technician just left. It was the power board that was failing progressively. I had the extended warranty with NEW and the first company they set me up with never showed. I called and asked for a different repair company that was closer geographically to my home. They then set me up with Falcones Electronics in Media Pa. They diagnosed the problem over the phone based on my description of what was happening, ordered the power board, and then just came this morning and installed it. My LCD is better than new now. The power board failure got worse over time until it got to the point that the TV would just not turn on. So if you see it getting worse (starts out as pink dots, then stripes, then won't turn on), it's the power board. They told me that without the warranty, it would have run me about $350 to fix. So I'm pleased that the warranty turned out to be a good investment and I'm once again very pleased with this TV. The technician told me that the failure rate on new electronics is about 3% so it's rare. Nonetheless, mine failed but was easily fixed. I paid $1800 for this TV just shy of 2 yrs ago and around $300 for the extended warranty with NEW through Amazon. Despite the initial glitch with NEW and the first company not showing up, not only do I have my TV back and working, I've also now discovered a great little electronics shop for anything else I might need done. I'm just amazed any more when I get good service. Can you tell?

review_title: Awesome TV for Standard Definintion viewing
review_text: The truth is most people still watch SD programming on their HDTVs. I wanted a TV that would give good SD quality and I think this one gives outstanding quality. I have Dish Network International programming (that won't be going HD any time soon) and the channels look great on this TV. Highly recommended.

review_title: Very Impressive!
review_text: In my recent quest to upgrade to HDTV, I got a little over zealous. I originally purchased a 50" Samsung model HP-S5053 Plasma. When I got it home, it just seemed a bit too large for my living room. After a week, I finally decided I just needed to go with a smaller screen, so I ended up with this 42" Panasonic, and boy am I glad I made the switch!The picture quality is much nicer and and it is extremely compatible with my cable remote. With the Samsung, I had to use both remotes, but with this one, I only need the cable remote. I'm not a techy type, so I can't speak to the technical aspects of the TV, but I know the picture is outstanding and the TV itself looks more attractive.It has 4 picture size settings. This is my one complaint, but I believe all HD TV's are like this. The first setting leaves bars on the side of the picture. This is the most accurate setting and is necessary to use when watching sporting events. The side bars are a little distracting and take some getting used to. The stretch setting makes people look short and squatty. The zoom one and zoom two settings lose the graphics bars at the top and bottom during sporting events. These are good, however, for watching movies if you don't mind losing the outer perameters of the picture.Overall, I'm very happy with this model. Gotta go now, the football games are coming on.

review_title: Great TV for the $$$$$$
review_text: I bought this TV at the end of March for my newly finished Den. I had narrowed it down to this and the Sony SXRD 60 XBR2, but it was about $1000 more. These two TV's had the best picture, so I saved the money and bought an entertainment center. The TV is awesome. I have digital Cable (Optimum) and the HD channels are great with HDMI. Also have an OPPO 1080P DVD and the picture is great. Regular TV is OK, but I find myself only watching the HD. I was skeptical about spending $2000 dollars online, but Amazon was great. Tv came in a week and Eagle delivery was great. No complaints so far. I got the 5 year warranty through Visa for under 200 bucks because I used my card. I know the new LED thin model is out, but if is like this TV, don't hesitate to buy.I have a friend who bought online from MyTaxFree at the same time and never got his TV.

review_text: This is my first HDTV and it lives up to expectations in a big way. The image is fine with one of the default profiles, I haven't felt the need to customize the settings. I haven't noticed any leakage either. I tested with a few bluray movies &amp; hd documentaries and I can't believe the detail - clearly with an old tv I was living in the dark ages.

review_title: I'M SPOILED
review_text: I had a 36" CRT TV in the den, which I thought had a great picture. However, I couldn't get my college-student son to watch a football game at the house [he has a 52" HDTV at the house he shares with 3 roommates]. He told me HDTV is just better.I got this TV set up just before the Super Bowl. My son, daughter, and son-in-law came over and watched the game at our house. They were all blown away by the picture of this TV! I've since installed surround sound (including in-wall speakers from Amazon) and I find myself drooling while watching TV! My son said he's going to watch every big game at home rather than deprive himself of perfection by watching TV with his friends. [OK....I'm exaggerating, but the picture on this TV is astounding!]

review_title: Excellent all around
review_text: This tv is exceptional for the money! It's got great quality, is easy to get started watching, and has great features. I purchased it at Costco, and the price was great. The only two complaints where that some of the controls on the remote weren't explained well enough in the manual (a minor complaint at best) and customer service was, quite frankly, unimpressive. They answered quickly, but sounded like they were reading from a manual that they weren't familiar with and didn't solve my problem of connecting to the internet at all (and I probably spent a total of 4 hours on the phone/computer with them). It was finally my cable person who fixed the problem, as the Samsung folks were clueless and had me doing the same things over and over again that didn't work (the definition of insanity?) So, while the tv works great, customer service is a bit lacking.

review_title: Disappointed, Folks!!
review_text: Okay, I waited three (3) months before posting this so that I would give some time for the initial enthusiasm to wear off. Well, it hasn't. I work in sales for an AV Rental agency, we set up for trade shows and business functions all over the lower 48. This Samsung blows away everything we have in stock, from 61" plasmas to 17" LCD monitors. The 1080p technology is definitely the way to go, and look at the contrast ratio-that should tell you the story. When we play HD and Blue Ray movies on this thing you have to see it to believe it. My son's PS3 plays Blue Ray games without any ghosting or hesitations-just like a computer monitor. The speakers are actually good quality, but for some reason Samsung has them pointing down and back, not forward (???). Don't know why. No matter, I am setting up a cheap amp with separate side speakers anyway. There are complete controls for the screen on the remote unit. The TV looks beautiful and graces any room; the soft, blue glow light when on is a nice touch. We watch this in our family room even during the day and do not have to shut the blinds on our windows. For performance, aesthetics and sound you won't do better than this. And I have seen thousands of them through the years.By the way, just as a side thought; I suggest ordering extra cables through Amazon at the same time. I only paid a couple of bucks each for them. Also - there is a lot of confusion out there about antennas. If you have a roof antenna already mounted, try that before purchasing another. I am currently using an indoor antenna and the picture is perfect. Do not be deceived by marketing hype, such as "Hi-Definition, High Performance antenna" etc. at inflated prices. It's just hype. There is no such thing as a "Hi-Definition" antenna, all are based on the same technical principles. Yes, there are some antennas that are superior in quality to others because of the way they are engineered, but that has nothing to do with the type of signal they will pull in. Try what you have now before purchasing a new one, most likely you will be pleasantly surprised and save yourself some money.The delivery service was outstanding. Courteous, well-organized and efficient, the men had the thing unpacked and mounted in minutes.*********************************************************************************Update Dec. 18, 2009: I am getting spots across the screen when first startup after sitting all night. That has progressed to an increasing slow, long startup after hitting the Power button on the remote. By turning off, then turning on I can get the spots to disappear. At least for now. Everything else is fine. Obviously it will totally fail soon. Too bad, it's just been hanging on my family room wall for two years, never been moved, bumped or banged and is connected to a high quality outdoor antenna. Disappointment, it didn't even last two years.

review_title: Do Not Buy Samsung LCD TVs - Broken After Short Period of Use
review_text: Not only should you not buy this model, do not buy ANY Samsung TVs. They do not last. Same problems as others have described, power cycling on/off all by itself, vertical lines on screen. Need to manually power off and on before it is suitable for viewing. I'm going back to Toshiba. Again, do not buy Samsung.Update 9/6/10: Repaired myself by replacing capacitors as described in the two-part video at [...]. On my unit there were two 10 volt 1000 mf capacitors that were bad. (You can spot them by looking for puffy tops.) They should be replaced with capacitors with a higher voltage rating and the same mf rating. I used 25 volt 1000 mf low ER capacitors sold by Greg Dement on eBay. The set turned on right away, and no vertical lines at all. Just like brand new. Capacitors cost $3.94 for a set of four, plus $2 shipping. There were three 10v 1000 mf capacitors, and I replaced all three, even though only two appeared to be bad. If you're not technically inclined you probably have a relative or friend that can do this job. Took about an hour and that was going slow.I bought a Toshiba 40UX600U while waiting for the capacitors to arrive and also to hedge my bet against the capacitor replacement not working. I love it. Now I have two working 40-inch TVs. I plan to put the repaired Samsung in a lesser-used room. Coincidentally, I also needed to buy a new dishwasher. Samsung makes dishwashers, but I will NEVER, EVER buy Samsung anything again. And I'm telling that to anyone who will listen. I tried the online Samsung repair form but all it kept saying was that it was out of warranty, even though some had success filling it out. They should have recalled this TV and done the right thing with customers. But as usual, some companies have morons in charge and would rather destroy customer loyalty forever to avoid a small repair cost.

review_title: Excellent deal.
review_text: Best price I've seen on this TV. Even after shipping, it's about $150 less than the local stores are selling it for. Packaging is well designed to make it easy to remove from the box, and setup was very easy. Picture quality is great, although I was disappointed to find that my local cable provider doesn't have HD channels yet. Still, I have an up-converting DVD player--a must have for getting rid of motion artifacts when watching DVDs on an HDTV. The picture is impressive even though it's not true high definition.Don't waste your money on brand name cables! Amazon has perfectly good generic HDMI cables for like $7!

review_title: outstanding high def picture, can't go wrong with this set.
review_text: I was leary purchasing a big ticket item TV over the net and having it delivered. The set arrived, way before the scheduled date, like about 3 or 4 days. It was great, but I didn't have the HD satllite scheduled for another week. didn't look so hot without the hd cable. Just got dish network installed today, and the picture is fantastic. when the TV arrived, the guy delivering was great, helped me bring it up stairs, he turned it on to make sure it worked before I signed for it. The whole process of buying and recieving this size TV was much easier than I would have thought. Amazon is great, and I am extra happy that I got it at $200 bucks less than it is now going for. Can't get too technical, but I really didn't do much to get it going, just plugged it in, set it to the settings that one person on this board advised, (thanks, saved me a lot of time) and that was it. The dish network guy was really good too, set it up without any problem, the picture is really breath taking. I cannot imagine a better picture, I mean, it's like Mt. Rainer is in my living room, can't get any better than that. And all the sport channels look great. football, baseball and even soccer look great. I am watching movies I would never before watch, the picture is so good. Sure glad I did not buy the Sony Grand wega, this beats it all ove the place. Would recommend this Tv. I have a fairly bright room and I don't see any glare, maybe I'm easy, but this whole experience is great. If you're in the market for a hd tv, this one is really worth considering.

review_title: Great Value, Great Price, Beautiful Picture
review_text: I spent many hours researching online and in stores comparing LCD, Plasma, and DLP HDTV's. Awesome picture without HD reception so far. If only the satellite companies would improve technology so that more than one TV can receive HD on a dual tuner/receiver. We started out looking at 32 inch and ended up with this 40 inch for our bedroom. The sleek style fits conveniently upon a chest of drawers, just the right height, and blends in with the decor of the bedroom. I ordered this TV on a Friday, it was shipped on Monday and by Thursday the TV had been delivered and set up by Egle. Shipping and handling I rate with 5 stars for the professional manner in which this transaction was handled. We are always pleased with Amazon's service.

review_title: Awesome 4k TV
review_text: Unbelievable picture! This is my third Samsung TV. I'm currently upgrading over my 60" Samsung Plasma. Love the Smart Hub and easy user friendly setting's and navigation. I do think the refresh rate for motion should be higher. Yes there are more pixels, but I have seen the TV lag a tad at times. Let me stress though it isn't a deal breaker. TV is pricey, but after seeing the picture worth every penny....

review_title: Well worth the money - excellent product
review_text: This TV is a very good value bargain.I am very happy with it - its colors are vibrant and the picture looks sharp. Very good contrast. I watch HDTV a lot, but it also does a good job with regular TV broadcast (I had experience with Sony 32' Bravia which was terrible with regular TV)Sound is also very good.It fits well in the living room, since it does not look that big (speakers are hidden in the bottom)I also hooked it up to my laptop, and now I have a 40' PC monitor with wireless keyboard & mouse.. amazingThe only complaints:1. Switching from one input source to another (e.g. PC&lt;->Cable) is a little slow2. The price dropped about $130 3 weeks after I bought it ..

review_title: Fantastic Picture with the Best Clarity
review_text: The picture is amazing and clear. Blu-ray DVDs make you feel like you are in the movie and 3D puts you over the top. Everyone has positive comments on how amazing it looks whether in bright daylight or at night. It is the centerpiece of the living area. Even the built-in camera is very cool and works great for Skype. I would highly recommend Samsung as the best on the market.

HD TV is even more of a in your face great looking thing. One thing many people who review this TV dont mention is, with the Xbox 360 playing games is clear as it gets beatiful looking gamesIf I had any complaints it would be the Resolution could have been a little higher and being that its a newer model 1080i native would be been even better.

review_text: I love the TV, it has all the bells and whistles, but do wish it was cheaper. I gave it very high reviews, but besides the price I wish it had a faster processor like the 2013 Quad Core models. This way the apps and DLNA might work a little faster. Thanks for listening! - get an external sound system, the internal TV speakers will not compare.

review_title: Micro Dimming Ultimate not working In Movie mode!
review_text: This 65" is a good TV, but can be an amazing TV if they gave us more control of the Dimming that's going on. Mostly CE Dimming and Micro Dimming. This 8000 is supposed to have a better Micro Dimming than the lower models, but to me and many others, it's not working and causing clouding and not the best black levels and contrast. I get the feeling that the Micro Dimming Ultimate, is just a marketing tool they use to get consumers to pay the extra money. They did this with the lower end models last year with 3D. They claimed that they had Full HD 3D and really they didn't. Once that was noticed by many consumers, they quickly changed their specs and description and had to take it off all of the boxes. Well, I have a feeling that they did it again with this Dimming feature. Another issue with these 65" is the quality control. Mine was delivered with a bad pixel in the center of the screen and also Vertical Banding. Those issues are related to the may they are manufactured. At this time, I really cannot recommend this model. At least until they put out a major Firmware update to fix the Dimming issue and auto dimming issue. It's so weird how a lot of the options we had on last years D8000 are no longer there. Black enhancer, edge enhancement, Smart LED.. Basically this model is a lower end compared to last years UND8000 series.. Be Smart!

review_title: Fantastic, right out of the box.
review_text: The idea of having a 'future proof' remedy built right into the command center of the TV sold me on the idea for stepping up to justify the additional cost over other HD tv's. The command center also makes easy setup and opperation of all other needed devices; i.e. DVD, Gaming, etc. I would recommend this to anyone toying with the idea of 4K TV.

review_title: High pitched noise -
review_text: I received this TV with the notorious high-pitched noise. It appeared within about 4-6 hours of use. I got on Samsung's web site to report the problem and an appointment to come to my house was scheduled within 6 hours. The technician knew exactly what the problem was and replaced the defective component.Great TV. Good colors. Good sound. Looks great on the wall. I've been purchasing Samsung computer monitors for years so I knew I wouldn't be disappointed, and I wasn't.

review_title: Amazing value all around!
review_text: After researching televisions, I was shocked that this model is as reasonably priced as it is despite being consistently touted as having the best plasma picture available.Upscaled SD and DVD media look great in Just mode but nothing could have prepared me for football on this set. It was stunningly clear to say the least. Blacks are deep and artifcating is minimal- the picture just looks good. I don't have a lot of plasma experience but my in-laws recently bought a Samsung HPS4253 and the upscaled SD / DVD picture quality is much better on the Panasonic than that set from what I've seen- an important consideration since most programming is still Standard Definitiion.On top of that, I got this baby for less that I could at a brick and mortar store with no sales tax and free shipping.And the topper for me? Amazon gave me a delivery date of the 11th. EGL [the freight company] gave me a date of the 9th on their web tracker. I got a call on the 4th to set a three hour delivery window on the 5th.I've never been happier with a major purchase.Kudos, Panasonic, Amazon and EGL!

review_title: Great Picture - Great Price
review_text: Best TV I've owned to date. It's only my 2nd flat screen but I do know quality. I did extensive research before purchasing. The colors are great, the picture is crisp and you will find it to be a very pleasant viewing experience. I would recommend this TV if you like the "set it and forget it" philosophy. It certainly makes things simpler and you get a great picture with the built in presets. Let me tell you that this is the TV to beat in terms of audio quality. It is EXCELLENT in that department. The thing gets plenty loud at a low level but at the same time the lowest volume is not overly loud at all. I love it. I don't think I could have made a better choice for the money I paid. The remote is awesome too. It's compact and has a back light. I do have to say that this TV is quite a bargain and there is not much that you will not like. Highly recommended.

review_title: Really good display
review_text: I've had the TV for about a month and after making the adjustments to the picture to remove the soap opera effect, and further minor tweaking, I am blown away by the picture quality. I use over-the-air broadcasts for HD and they look awesome (no idea how cable will look). The SMART TV blends the TV guide info from the internet with the antenna channels to provide a "cable-like" guide channel that can be used to browse and schedule shows. No DVR though. Display is matted enough not to reflect too much light, although I have to turn off a light that reflects directly into my viewing angle, but no problems in a brightly lit room with a large 8-ft patio door. I had a Samsung DLP that (in my opinion) had the most natural colors and image, but this set can get pretty close with the right settings. Would definitely recommend.

review_title: Nothing but grief from Amazon and Samsung
review_text: I received delivery of the tv in late August 2006, it worked for 8 hours and then just died. I called Samsung and they asked me to try something and then something else. Nothing worked. After many no answers and disconnects I finally got through to them(Samsung service), I was told that when people have my problem(vertical lines of differing size and color with only sound) that the display is defective. I was told I would receive a call about the replacement of the set, that was August 28, 2006. I have not heard from them yet. I tried to get some action with my credit card company(Citi) with no luck. This is probably going to the courts so just BEWARE of buying a big ticket item from Amazon, better just go to a brick and mortar store and play it safe.

review_title: Excellent TV for the price, sound could be a bit better
review_text: I ordered this TV on a Friday and it arrived the following Monday much to my surprise. I got a call from the delivery guy on a Sunday afternoon saying I would get the tv on Monday afternoon. Awesome, he showed up a bit early and set it up for me to make sure it was working and everything was ok. Great service. The TV is impeccable, I have been researching tvs and deals on tvs for months now and finally bought this tv. The price on Amazon is unbeatable and this tv is well worth what it is going for now. The inputs are great, the tv size is perfect for someone who wants a classy design for a good size room. I will say that some tweaking with the picture will have to be done so that it is to your liking, but check the forums out there like [...]for this help, you wont be sorry. The sound could be a little better, but honestly I only notice it with a movie that has a lot of deep bass or something and I have it turned way up. During normal viewing you wont notice anything. May be worth the money to get a surround sound system if you intend on making this your home theater tv...but the picture is absolutely stunning. Best blacks of any LCD that I have found and with some minor tweaking the grayscale is really good, definetly rivals most all Plasma displays. Get an OTA antenna for HD broadcasts for free, use the channel manager for the channels picked up and just enjoy the capability of this TV...excellent buy! Thanks Amazon.

review_title: Very happy with new TV
review_text: I bought Nov. 2006 and I'm very happy with the TV. Great picture. Saved money buying online. As others have stated, the sound is fine for watching the news or talk show but not great for movies where there are more sounds going on.I was wary of buying something at this price online but everything was well packaged by Samsung and delivered as promised by Amazon.Bottom line: I would buy the same TV again.

review_title: Shiny is nice!!
review_text: Ordered on a Friday, set arrived in town on Tuesday, set up Saturday appointment, saved me taking off from work. The 'white glove guys' set it on my stand, saved the packing just in case. Amazon reduced price after I noticed 100 dollar drop and called. I would order from Amazon again...GOOD SERVICE. The best part is the TV itself. Cable HD great, SD is better than my older 50 inch Panny LCD project. This the clearest set I have seen within a working guys budget. Have Sansung upconvert 1080P DVD player using HDMI, no problems, as Borat would say....NICE!

review_title: Great TV for the Price
review_text: This is a great TV. We have had this for almost a month now. Has great picture quality. We use it to watch cable, and have a Roku box hooked up to it as well. We will soon be using it for gaming when we get our PS3 as well. My only drawback to it (not a big one at all, I knew it didn't allow it when I bought it) is not being able to use a USB wireless stick. No big thing honestly, but I think it should at least be able to :P Great TV, Samsung makes some quality products. We own a galaxy note 10.1, galaxy S3 and this TV as well.

review_title: Amazon will just bend you over a chair
review_text: I ordered this item and then 30 minutes later went to cancel the order because JR dot com has it for cheaper with faster shipping. I was then told I couldn't cancel the order because it had already entered the "shipping process" but wasn't to be delivered until 1/16/07!I was told that I could refuse delivery but I would be charged a restocking fee and return shipping charges and won't get a refund for another 14 days after they receive the item back. Do yourselves a favor and order this and everything else from any other place then Amazon.com. These people are incompetent dumbasses!

review_text: I would recommend this to a friend! The High Def of this TV is amazing.Clear, crisp, bright and everything has so much depth. I never thought it would be so dramatically different from the TV I have been watching for years. Well worth the money and the SMART TV features increase the flexibility of watching my favorite shows. I am no longer limited by the size of the DVR hard drive! The only "con" is that the built in speakers seem weak on their own. But since it is connected to my home theater system, that is not a problem. Love it. So happy!

It was sharper, brighter but the LCD color is not as rich as the Plasma. It was narrower than many other 46" HDTV and I was able to squeeze it into same location.

review_text: I really love this TV! It was easy to hook up and set up. I have it hooked up to Charter Cable, and a Samsung HD860 DVD player. The HD picture is breathtaking of course, but the picture on non HD channels is fantastic as well.The HD860 DVD player makes regular DVDs come alive with it's upconverting to HD capability. It is easily worth twice the $90 I paid for it.Amazon's price was lower than anwhere else, and I got the TV in just over a week! I highly reccommend them.Also, Samsung's support is great. I had a small problem that turned out to be in the set top box, and Samsung was very helpful in finding it. Real American English is spoken there.

review_text: lasted 2 1/2 years. Tv started taking long to turn on. Samsung replaced capacitors even though it was out of warranty. I then told the tech the picture wasn't the same. Next day I noticed 3 lines on right side of TV. Samsung won't repair or replace. Said it is a totally different problem. Well there shouldn't be any problems. No more samsung for me. $1600 down the drain. Well after much arguing back and forth with Samsung they sent someone out to look at my TV again. They told me it was a bad panel but they are going to replace. I am thankful they are replacing but a tv should last much longer than 2 1/2 years. Even the tv repair man said if Samsung was not going to cover I should just go buy a new TV. He said a panel replacement can be $1000.00

review_text: We have had this TV for about two months and have no complaints. The quality and features are very good. You could spend a few hundred more if your are a purist, but I doubt that you would see much qualitative improvement. When you are looking at every pock mark and scar on a persons face in closeups, you sometimes think that maybe there is such a thing as too good. The available media also needs to catch up with this technology.Buy the way, don't let anyone snooker you into an expensive cable. The one I ordered was late so I bought the monster mash at the city. When mine came - back it went - absolutely no difference. Likewise with the expensive HDTV antenna at the Best.

review_title: Overall very satisfied
review_text: I have had the TV for a few weeks now and I must say I am very happy with the overall design, features, and performance. It's more like a hybrid computer than a TV. The smart TV is awesome, I love that it has built in Wi-Fi which allowed me to connect to my Hulu, Netflix, and MLB accounts and also running Windows 7 on my home computers has allowed me to view and listen to all my network shared media. I also love the iPhone App which allows me to control the smart TV better than the supplied remote. All this and I haven't even mentioned the 3D content. A really cool feature. Right now Comcast provides 2 channels and on-demand content, everyone I have shown the TV to wants one! Pandora runs great, drops into screensaver mode as it runs so no screen burning. I found myself letting this run during the day, makes for great background atmosphere as you do your chores. I also picked up a wireless kybd/mouse which to my surprise the TV immediately recognized and connected to. Makes using the browser functional. Ok, so now the bad as nothing is perfect. The remote control does not allow you to control other devices so you will need to continue to use your other remotes. I find the Smart TV feature slow to start up at times and the general operation of this feature rich TV is kind of overwhelming for my wife who is technically challenged. The sound is OK depending on the content you are watching / listening to. I found it to be low on some of my movies. It would be much better if you could jump in an out of the apps so you could multi-task but right now If I want to watch a game on MLB and also on cable I have to exit and restart the MLB app.

review_text: Excellent TV, love the color and HD capabilities. I wanted this TV for the SmartHub, overall satisfied with it, but there is always room for improvement. I was a bit disappointed with the web browser, as there were times when some media on certain websites was not accessible. Apps are updated regularly and the experience has improved over 6 months. To be perfectly honest, I am very happy with my purchase, since the most important thing is picture quality in a TV, and this plasma delivers.

review_title: Why did I wait so long!
review_text: I love this TV, I had a 32 inch Samsung and love it as well. Going from a smaller screen to this one is quite a difference. You feel like you are on the set and at first it almost looks fake. The set was easy to get up and running and I located some recommended settings online for picture quality and then played a bit to get it to my sweet spot. Some reviews said the sound was poor but it is just fine for a TV, it's not home theater quality but that is not what you bought. Hook it up to a home theater and enjoy quality sound with the quality picture. Still getting use to the special features of the smart part of this TV, so much you can do. I feel it is a great purchase.

review_title: Simply magnificent!!!
review_text: I have owned this set for one year now and it perfroms perfectly still to this day. I did much research prior to making this purchase and am so glad I did. I made many comparisons before the purchase and am still making comparisons to this day every time I view another plasma/lcd set. I can honestly say that this set blows anyhting away that I have seen in a store or in another home.Panasonic hit a grand slam with this set. It is not 1080p but with thie 720p/1080i it is still magnificent and out perfroms any 1080p set I have seen. (except for maybe the Panasonic 1080p set) This is my opinion and it may appear biased but I feel strongly about this. I use it with a Toshiba A-3 HD-DVD player and get perfect picures there and with the HD television I receive. If you are in the market for this, get this while they are still available.

review_text: I got this to replace my 10 year old projection TV, what an upgrade.This is by far one of the best TV's on the market today! If you purchase this TV go ahead and get yourself the new Samsung 2014 note tablet. If you do you'll be blown away with what you can do . The two products work perfectly in sink with each other.The smart features just cannot be out done. In conclusion: I would not be surprised if other manufactures are taking notes on this TV / Tablet combo to set there Goals for their future productions.

review_title: Awesome TV; Awesome price
review_text: If you have any doubts, forget them....buy the TV. It is fabulous. We brought it home, mounted it on the wall, plugged it in and the television did the rest...it programmed itself. The only thing I had to do was re-program my cable remote. The absolutely best picture, clairty, sound I have ever experienced in a television. Nothing against Amazon (I've purchased many items from Amazon) but I did get a much better price from Best Buy. Apparently most people don't realize you can negotiate prices with them. My original quoted (sticker) price was $2,499, by the time I finished haggling with them I purchased the set for $1,500 including tax. I LOVE THIS TV!

Panasonic has finally given up sending people out to fix it. Now if i want anything I have to pay myself when the TV was a lemmon to begin with. What a joke you pay $1400 for a TV and they rip you off. This TV has 3 common problems 1 The power board (when this happens it will not turn on) 2 The electronics package ( when this happens it give u bar code lines usually the left hand side 3 The plasma screne itself ( when this happens half or all the screne will go black or white) DO NOT BUY THIS TV

However about one (1) year after I bought it, the screen had to be replaced. It just made warranty. Now seven (7) months later and out of warranty, the TV is out again! I am looking for a way to repair it myself because they want $500.00 to repair it. I made everyone I know get Samsung LCDs. One of the other LCD with a different model number had similar problem after about two (2) years after he bought his.

review_text: Great TV, it was working on the internet and completely set up within 5 minutes. My only downside to this product is the design. All the inputs are on the left side of the TV (As you face it). I had to run my wires into the wall from the side and not behind the TV. It looks OK, but you can see a little of the cover where the wires enter the wall. The remote is also weak, I have a Samsung BlueRay player and the TV remote can't control it.

review_text: The purchase of the Samsung LNS4051D is my first foray in the world of HDTV. I've sat on the sidelines for a few years watching HD technology mature. When I saw the Samsung 4051 at Circuit City I knew the time had come to purchase a television.This particular TV's reviews in the press has been at best. I compared the specs. and the picture of the other competitors and found that the Samsung overall was the best for me. I won't go into the particulars, but this TV deserves a look-see.My experience with Eagle USA transport, the company Amazon uses, was great. The delivery was quick and uneventful.

review_title: Excellent picture quality
review_text: The picture quality is excellent - however you must have HD content or UHD content to really enjoy it. Moved to an HD plan and the resulting experience is amazing. Great TV. The only downside - the sound quality is poor as expected for a thin TV like this. You certainly need an external sound system/amplifier .

review_title: Great TV!!
review_text: Picture quality is the best I've seen. SmartTV functions are great, recommendations are getting better the more I use it. Only gripe I have is that the Rovio guide shows all channels when I only care about HD channels. There should be a way to hide channels you don't want. 3D works well, picture very crisp, no cross-talk.

review_title: Best picture quality I've ever seen on a tv at this price!! Plus you get all the goodies
review_text: This TV is amazing. The picture quality is amazing. And there is so much more. With all the HDMI inputs available, I can hookup all my devices no problem. The TV is only an inch and a quarter in depth and looks amazing hanging on a wall with optional accessories. Of coarse there is so much to watch with the wifi availabitly and the 3D is amazing. I couldn't ask for a better tv for the price. I've seen many pricier tv's that don't even come close to the quality of this class. So don't waste your money. Samsung is the leader no doubt in quality and performance when it comes to the newest technology out there. You will not be disappointed!!! I failed to mention how picky I am when it comes to my electronics! This television is an A plus in my book no doubt!! Definitely recommend to family and friends! Don't hesitate to get first class at a price that can't be beat.

review_title: A High Quality Product.
review_text: We've had this set for about a year and a half now and we really enjoy it. My only real regret is not getting a bigger screen, but my wife didn't want a set too large for our smallish living room. However, she was pleasantly surprised at how nice this "piano black" Samsung looked there and we both just love watching TV on it, expecially in HD. Even the remote looks and feels stylish.My one criticism is with the 2 zoom modes. "Zoom 1" should back off just a little...it cuts off a little more than it needs to to optimize a wide-screen standard def picture. "Zoom 2" is completely useless.BTW, as far as I can tell this set does not do 1080i, just 720p. This has not been an issue thus far, as all HD programming we get is 720p, but there will be a BluRay player in its future, which does 1080p and it would be nice to know we're getting the highest res picture there is...but again, this matters less on a smaller TV like this.For the 8 feet average distance from our couch to the set, I think a 42 inch would be perfect, so I've started poking around at the latest Sharp Aquos 42", and for not much more than the $900 or so we paid for this, you get a 10 inch bigger screen, 1080p, twice as fast response time and slightly better contrast ratio in a fairly compact package. This would bump the Sharp into a smaller room in the house which would work better for a 32".

review_title: Overall great purchase
review_text: Quality of the the TV is excellent. HD channels look awesome. So far I can say that glare is not an issue and I have a pretty bright living room. I have seen many other TV's which have some ghosting, but I can say with this set there has been absolutely none. Price was unbeatable.Delivery was great, I called Eagle once Amazon had listed the package as delivered and set up an appointment. They originally gave me a 5 hour window, but asked if they could narrow the window and they did so by making it a 3 hour window. Delivery guy gave me no problem when I made him wait while I turned on the TV and checked everything out (looked for dead pixels, etc.).Overall excellent, highly recommended.

review_title: Amazing Smart TV (UN40EH5300FXZA)
review_text: I bought 40'' Samsung Smart TV from Costco with a manufacturer discount coupon. The assembly was easy to do and went well. The manual is poorly designed. I wish it was more descriptive. It took me some time to configure WiFi. However, after couple of trials I was able to get it done. Sound is great, picture quality is excellent. Little disappointed with remote as it is not very responsive at some Angles. Initially going to SmartHub was easy. However, after 2-3 weeks, the SmartHub became slow, it takes almost 30-35 seconds to open SmartHub. I am going to call to Samsung Customer Center for feedback if I am missing any upgrade for SmartHub. Overall, this TV is a great buy and I would recommend it to anyone who is beginning with LED Smart TV.

review_title: Bravia KDL400V3000
review_text: After several weeks of research on my first LCD HDTV, I decided to go with the sony brand based on user reviews. My only problem was that I needed to narrow it down because there are so many different models. I knew that 1080p was the way to go, so that helped a little, but by comparing the different sony models side by side at a local store, I found that this model was the second best in the lineup. Just a notch below the XBR this television gives a great quality picture and tons of features. I especially like the customization and setup options available on the sony model I purchased. It allows you to really set the unit up how you want it. The only minor complaint I have is that in 480i mode, when the tv is turned on, it will default to 4:3 instead of 16:9 like I have specified in the setup. A quick change to an HD signal and back fixes it, so it is only a minor annoyance. Otherwise it has worked flawlessly for me in the month that I have owned it.

review_title: Great TV
review_text: I just received my 4065f. First a word about the shipping and delivery. I ordered on a Friday and received the TV within 6 business days. Eagle delivery was great. They brought it in, unpacked it and they were right on time.Now for the TV itself.The picture is absolutely perfect. There are many detailed settings for color preferences but don't let that scare you. I had my TV plugged in and the color tuned in to my taste within 10 minutes.The clarity of the picture is great and the color is superb. The high contrast ratio probably rivals any plasma. The blacks are black and the whites are white. I would higly recommend this TV to anyone in the market for full 1080p hd. Don't even waste your time looking at a 720p. Spend a few extra bucks and get full HD.I looked at comparable TVs from Toshiba, Sharp, Sony. None of them matched the features or picture of this TV though they cost more money in some cases. For the money, the features, this is the one to buy.The only problem I have is that now Amazaon is offering the same TV for $100 less just 10 days after I bought it. Hey, I'm still happy because compared to local stores, I still saved about $400.Buy it now!

review_title: I love cyber weekends.
review_text: I bought this as an early Christmas present for my wife and myself. I knew it would be a good product but it still surprised me how good it looks. I read a lot before buying and I decided this is a better deal than the F8000 model. There is a huge amount of customization you can do to the picture. The remote is awesome and we no longer need three remotes to run the DVR, Blu-Ray, and TV. Voice commands, keyboard, motion sensor/camera, touch pad, etc. We use the Galaxy and Note smartphones so Samsung link blends right in. The Evolution upgrade ability makes this an even smarter choice. Very happy.

review_text: Samsung's 60" smart TV has a design defect, the main board over heats and makes the TV crazy, this happened to my TV after one year of very mild use. I am on a very tight budget and can't afford to pay for repairs, this was a huge investment for me and Samsung won't fix it under the warranty because the year just expired. Due to this situation Samsung's 60" smart TV is the worst TV I ever purchased. Please do not purchase one.

review_title: Netflix Hero.
review_text: I haven't had a lot of time with this TV yet but here is what I think so far. Great picture, even though I get quite a bit of sunlight in the room at certain times. The netflix app is easier to see and use and is way faster than it is on either of my bluray players. It has a good DTV tuner and I really like the channel guide with the ability to schedule upcoming shows so the TV switches channels to them when they come on. The remote is cool but takes some getting used to.

review_title: AWESOME TV -- Worlds Pickiest Buyer!
review_text: OK Everyone: I am going to tell you- I went everywhere- spent countless hours comparing specs, picture quality, reviews and all of the above to make this purchase.. Being a Single Mom and no personal experience buying a quality TV before- I wanted to make the right purchase.. I knew I wanted to keep my purchase under $1500 and get HD-1080 and at least a 40inch screen.. I had just purchased (2) Flat Samsung 19inch PC monitors and have never owned a Samsung before- Being so impressed with the PC monitors quality- I started doing research on their TV models. I went to the local stores and compared Pictures- I found myself gravitating back to the Samsung everytime- Then I saw this model- with the Clear Screen option-- and it was 1080- Comparing to the models that did not have it --I liked the fact that it does not have the compete 'flat' LCD look- and has a little clear coat over that- It's like the best of both LCD & Plasma-- It is placed in a room with a lot of light- I have no issue with glare at all! The HD quality is so clear- I never knew the TV could look so real--clear and crisp! Accessories I bought: Knowing very LITTLE about the wiring needed- I also purchased the "WireLogic HDTV Hook-Up Kit for Tabletop TVs and Entertainment Centers" You get everything you need in one box! For both the cable and a DVD player hook up. Even extra for (2) other accesories i.e. vcr etc. I bought the "Samsung DVD-1080P7 Up-Converting 1080p DVD Player" and all my DVD's play in 1080- WOW! I have not seen a bad or questionable picture yet-- A side note for the 'gamers' out there- My Son plays his Nintendo Game Cube on this and the graphics are awesome! No problems noted! He figured out the remote and all the options (He is only 10) :-) I have never seen 'Mario" look so good! LOL.I am trying out the cable company's latest Cable-DVR box-for 3 mos.. (It's like TiVo) I think Im hooked! I was able to hook the TV up to the cable DVR signal in a matter of a few minutes right out of the box.. YEAH!!I was proud of myself.. So, Ladies.. and Gents for that matter- You dont have to be an electrician or audiophile to do the install! THIS TV ROCKS! You wount be sorry!! And. It looks AWESOME too! BUY IT. Ohh and Amazon rocked the sales price-- No One could or would even come close to beating it locally -- Delivery was a breeze- Thanks Amazon! I had a VERY MERRY Christmas indeed!

review_text: Our family purchased this a couple hundred dollars off retail price. The picture quality on this TV is awesome. Even when the room is bright, the tv picture doesn't get affected, and I can see everything clearly. Very easy to use, and setup. We will definitely be looking into purchasing a bigger one of this model when the time comes.

review_title: Great TV and even better Samsung Service
review_text: HD picture is great and there are sooo many inputs. TV had that high-pitched noise after 3-4 hrs of watching but i got that fixed through Samsung under warranty. They just replaced a coil that was making the noise in the power supply and it's now all good again. I'm not complaining about the problem because I only paid $450 for an open-box/refurbished one.

review_title: Great TV
review_text: Have had the LNT4065F, for 6 weeks now. Flawless performance. I chose this set over the LNT4061due to better black levels and off-angle viewing. Yes, there is reflection in the glossy screen whichcan be an issue for some, but the improvement in black levels is an acceptable tradeoff. The soundquality is only average, but OK for a bedroom set. Samsung's next generation LCD sets have addressedthe glare issues while maintaining or even improving on their industry-leading standard of black level performance. Consider the newest generation of sets (aggressive pricing). Four days ago I took deliveryof the LN46A650 for my living room and its PQ does indeed surpass the LNT line of sets IMO. BTW, verysatisfied w/Eagle in delivery process.

review_title: Superb picture quality
review_text: I did plenty of research before buying a TV. After listening to people who knew TV's, I decided on the Samsung 51" plasma with 1080p. I couldn't be happier with the picture quality I get on my TV. There are other reasons to look at different models, but when it comes down to the bottom line, the picture quality is why you should buy a TV. You can't beat the picture here.

review_title: Best bang for the buck!
review_text: Let's cut to the chase and answer lingering questions about plasmas and how this TV compares in those regards: Is it viewable in the daytime? This was one of my concerns due to the wall of windows in our open-floor living room. Rest assured, this TV is very bright and is easily viewed even during the brightest part of the day. Yes, it is highly reflective, but the light doesn't scatter when it hits the screen, so the overall picture isn't washed out like it can be with LCDs and edge-lit LEDs. What about burn-in/image retention? I've had this set for three weeks, just past the critical 100-hour stage where image retention and burn-in typically occur. This set does an outstanding job, I've yet to see the slightest hint of image retention, and I've been looking for it. Having an older plasma that did have IR I know what to look for. The colors and black levels of this set are excellent, it's like seeing HD for the first time all over again. Of course, the viewing angle of plasma is best in the business as well, so no problems there. All in all it's hard to find fault with this TV. I gave it 4 stars for features because it does not offer any sort of internet or "smart" connectivity. This was perfect for me since I already have a Roku, and I was able to save a significant amount by choosing a TV without those features. I believe this TV is the best bargain in the TV industry in 2013. If image quality and a good value are important to you, then you should definitely give this Samsung a chance.

review_title: What to expect from a Sony TV other than great!
review_text: I made a long and extensive market and product research before I finally bought the SONY KDL-40V3000. And until now I never regret it. Even if you spend some dollar more compare to other TV's but it's worth it. It's my third SONY TV now and most likely I will stay with this brand. If you go into the big stores and see all of these TVs on display than you are starting comparing the different pictures. When you finally found the best pictures you can be sure it's a SONY.It's easy to setup and have many connections.The only thing I really miss is a real switch off. The TV is always on Stand-By which I don't like. It would safe some energy with a real switch-off.But that's it, what I miss.

review_title: awesome 3d tv
review_text: I was in the market for a new 3d hdtv for my bedroom. i didn't want a smart tv since i own a ps3 and didn't see the benefit of paying extra for one. I simply wanted a hdtv with 3d capabilities for gaming and the occasional 3d blu-ray. In terms of picture quality it's great, I did my best to calibrate it using the spears and munsil disc. the screen looks natural and clear with great color I did notice some ghosting but with gaming mode turned on it went away. i'm not a hardcore videophile so take that for what it's worth. the 3d effect is great, i was playing uncharted 3 in 3d and was impressed with the 3d quality. if your looking for a 3d hdtv for a reasonable price this is a great contender.

review_title: The Smart TV is pretty good!
review_text: I like this TV so far, I just have it for couple of weeks so I can't say much. I wish that when I bought it I was explained the year series, meaning that there are new models with features I would have liked to have. The control remote is not as good as it should be for a Smart TV. Also, I think the manual should be reviewed and updated. I still can't figure out how to use PIP. I am using a digital antenna and PIP is not working. Also, if you want to have access to future channel program information, antenna should be in Auto (not in manual) which is not in the manual. Other than the above, I think this TV is pretty good.

review_title: This is probably the best 1080P LCD HDTV in the market!
review_text: The LNT4065 TV produces amazing pictures with vibrant colors. Sound from TV is decent. Remote, when compared to my Panasonic plasma is poorly designed. When it comes to picture quality, this LCD beats all its competitors hands down . The piano black finish combined with the glossy screen is very mesmerizing to look at. This TV handles glare with ease. I have my TV in a room that has 4 windows and a large patio door with a lot of sunlight coming in. Glare is never a problem. (Plasmas can't handle glare this well).Purchased the LNT4065 thru Amazon. Amazon is a pleasure to deal with and delivers the best value for your money. Amazingly quick ( TV was delivered in 3 days even though they say it will take 10 days) and FREE delivery via Eagle Shipping. I read some reviews that complained about Eagle Shipping. Let's just keep in mind that we are getting free shipping from Amazon, plus tax free low price. If the delivery guy does not smile, no big deal. As long as he delivers the TV in good shape, and in the time window promised, I am happy. Also, there was a price drop two weeks after I purchased. I called customer service and they did refund me the difference.Originally purchased the LNT4061 40" from Amazon. Was not happy with the picture quality. Returned the LNT4061 to Amazon and got a full refund in 7 days. Shipping was free both ways. Amazon sent Eagle Shipping to my home to pick it up. The guy helped me pack it up - WOW! Amazon beats store purchase experience on all counts. This is true only when the product is sold by Amazon. Some times it is sold by a partner. You probably won't get free shiping if you buy from a partner. So pay attention to the partners shipping policy before you place the order.Over all, if you are in the market for a 40" LCD TV, LNT4065 in my opinion is the undisputed champion!!

review_title: Caution: Migranes Ahead
review_text: This is my second Samsung. I bought it based on positive experience with my first 26" Samsung. Anyway, shortly after setup, a high-pitched squeeling noise developed. It wasn't noticable all the time, but it kept returning under various conditions. It seemed to come from the lower left hand side from rear of the unit. Besides squealing, the stand leaned to the left and no adjustments available. Overall, nice picture, beautiful design, easy to use, but the screeching will give you a migrane. Returned it and bought a 32" Sony Bravia XBR (KDL32XBR4) for a few $$ more. Be sure to look for the XBR4 model because it has Motionflow 120Hz speed and 10-bit processing. HD is absolutely amazing on the XBR4. The KDL32XBR4 is by far the best 32" set on the market. Check it out and compare the Sony side-by-side before you purchase this 32" Samsung.

We also checked prices at all the box stores and other online sources and combined with free shipping and no tax, Amazon had the best deal. The tv was shipped even ahead of schedule. We only wish that there were more HD channels available. We also bought a upconverter dvd player which gives us a great picture on our dvds.

review_title: Best 32'' on the market!
review_text: I am 100% satifified with this purchase. I read all the major reviews on CNet and elsewhere for 32'' LCD tvs and this came out as the best. The price was great. The picture is gorgeous. 8000:1 contrat ratio, 720p, bright, sharp picture. If you're gonna get something larger than a 32'', you might wanna make the jump to 1080p, but the 32'' size is perfect for that resolution. Xbox 360, HD DVD, HDtv, and (that which matters most: football) couldn't be prettier. I feel like I could lick the perspiration off of Reggie Bush's forhead (not that I would want to, it just feels like I could.) The tv itself is beautiful piano black finish. If you're in the market for a 32'', look no further. Sony guts!

review_title: Clear Picture
review_text: Replaced my Sony lcd with this tv. I have been a Sony guy since I paid for my very first tv when I was a teenager. After seeing the tv in the store and doing my research on it I decided this is the one. After setting it up in my house and watching it for the first time I now feel like my past years of tv/movie watching was done with stone age technology. For functions and picture quality this unit can not be beat. I got my own mother to buy one so that should answer all questions about who I would recommend this tv to.

review_title: Great HDTV Buy
review_text: This picture on set is simply beautiful -- and it looks as good off as it does on. Initially, based on online reviews, I thought I'd end up buying a Sony XBR SXRD, but after comparing the two sets side by side (as well as others), I couldn't justify spending significantly more money for something that really didn't look any better (and the Dumbo-eared Sony isn't as aesthetically pleasing either). I never thought I'd end up making a major acquisition like this from Amazon or any online retailer, but it had the lowest price on this set by far (several hundred dollars), free delivery, and no taxes. And, the delivery service was better than expected. Amazon uses the same people who do Crutchfield's "white glove" deliveries. I just wish there were more HD channels...

review_title: Great TV
review_text: I bought this product for the included cleaning cloth but the TV was a great addition! I don't know that much about LCD/Plasma TV's, but I do know that watching 1080p blu-rays on this is spectacular on this TV--watching Apocolypto was mesmerizing during the human sacrifices. You could see each person's face perfectly in the crowd down below from way up on the sacrificial pyramid thing! It almost ruined the effect because instead of seeing a crowd of angry, blood-thirsty, and heart-hungry people you saw a whole bunch of individuals jumping up and down like fools. This TV's clarity is unbelievable!I also have a PS3 (bought it originally from Amazon, but their lack of regard to my problems--although I am accustomed to good service here--made me want to give even this TV 0 stars!) and 1080P games like Ridge Racer, NBA 2k7, and Virtua Tennis look mesmerizing. When I was playing NBA 2k7 on the PS3 my dad came in, watched the TV casually for a minute, and then said, "Wait, this is a video game???"Anyway, enough about the PS3... I will now try to crank out some bad things about this TV. *fifteen minutes later* Ok, I thought of two. The TV's glossy panels collect dust (cleaning cloth covers that) and the TV takes a few seconds to start up. Also, in the category of glossiness, the screen WILL glare if you have a lamp on behind you (obviously), so you will want to change your lighting accordingly. It handles natural light well, but you can't expect it to be unaffected by a lightbulb.Eagle shipped this TV in an excruciating 8 days--but still, I guess they made the deadline. (Although, seeing as it only had to come from PA to NJ, and it arrived in a town near me in 4 days, this still a bit dissapointing.)Dust and EGL aside, buy this TV!

review_title: Great Buy!
review_text: I have nothing but good things to say about my TV purchase. Approximately a month ago I purchased the Samsung LNS4051D 40" inch TV at very low price. ie, compared to the local electronic stores. The TV shows an awesome picture as was advertised. The TV was delivered free to my apartment earlier than expected. The delivery people brought the TV into my apartment and unboxed it. The instructions to set up the TV were not the best but okay. Within 15 minutes I was watching beatiful HD programs on my Samsung TV. (Note I already had HD service from my cable company). By the way, the Amazon salespeople were helpful, knowledgeable and courteous. At first I was reluctant about purchasing the TV over the internet. However they made they made me feel at ease.There is so much more good things that I could say about my purchase but I have to go. I leave by saying, there is no doubt in my mine that I made a Great Buy. I am thorouly satisfied with my purchase.

review_title: disappointed
review_text: I did a lot of research and thought this was the way to go. It certainly looked nice when I checked it out at Fry's. Overall, I think the quality with both HDTV and upgraded DVD was disappointing. I played around with all the setting but just couldn't get the sharpness I was expecting with a 1080. There was also several dozen pixels that seemed to be "out". The reason I returned it, however, was the the second HDMI input didn't work: anything hooked up to that one flickered on/off and looked serious degraded from a digital standpoint. The other 2 HDMI inputs were fine, but again not as good as I expected. I ordered a 50" plasma (Samsung 5064), which I expect will be better despite the fact it is not a 1080. The plasma just arrived shattered (!) so I am still trying to successfully buy a flat screen TV from Amazon and Samsung!

review_title: Great TV
review_text: Purchased this TV as a replacement for a Samsung 50" 720p plasma and the difference in picture quality is amazing. Love the size and features but an external audio source is needed for optimum sound quality. Other than that, this is a wonderful TV and an excellent bang for your buck.

review_title: Know the ins and outs before you buy an HD TV
review_text: This Samsung TV is an excellent product. We bought it as a bedroom TV to replace a 26 inch conventional model. Understand that this TV is going to have a higher resolution than most of the signals you will send it. We have the system hooked up to DISH HD, a Playstation 2 and a Zenith DVD/VCR combo. The DISH HD output looks pretty good via HDMI. The Playstation 2 output is as good as you can get from a Playstation 2. The Zenith output is often pixelated and grainy. That's what happens when you mix and match old technology with new technology. I can live with it but consumers have a responsibility to understand that this TV will not make your old videotapes look better. In fact, they will look worse. So will DVDs unless you invest in progressive scan.The TV itself is well designed with an excellent picture (depending on source quality). Blacks look pretty black and we have experienced none of the blurring some older LCD TV owners complain about. Only one thing about this unit irritates me - the control on the right side of the TV itself. They are very hard to read. If you'll be using a remote exclusively it won't be a problem.Overall I look forward to years of happy ownership.

review_title: Very satisfied
review_text: Just received the TV from Eagle two weeks ago. This is my second Sam product bought from Amazon. Have had no problems with Amazon or Eagle either time. Tv is very nice. I went to BB to compare it "live" to other comparable models. It definately had one of the best pictures especially for the price. My Sam 50" DLP still has a sharper picture than the LCD, but the flat panel can hang on the wall.

review_title: Great picture but washes out on sides
review_text: Hi, the UN60F7100 LED is a great TV. Only problem is when you move to the left or right, the picture starts washing out, gets lighter or cloudy. And when I set the Contrast, Blacklight, Brightness, etc, to avoid this, then watching directly in front, the picture is too strong. Most people would not see this but my last two Samsung's were Plasma's, which have a consistent picture throughout the entire screen with no noticeable change in Brightness from side to side. If anyone knows how to make mine better, please advise. Thanks

However: 1. the limited buffering capacity makes streaming from the internet difficult if not impossible is some circumstances. 2. the screen is quite glossy and reflective for an LED. I would recommend connecting a computer to the TV via HDMI to improve navigation of the internet and streaming.

Samsung is a leader in the Hi-Def TV market and this LCD certainly shows why. My only wish is that the 32" inch model was offered in a white bezel like last year's model.

review_title: Great Service, Amazon!
review_text: I read lots of reviews of this TV as well as others, and yes, the TV is gorgeous. Regarding sound, I think Samsung made the right compromise. It's completely fine for a small room; if you have a big room, you have space for a more extensive sound system.What I actually want to review is Amazon's service. I found them offering this TV not at the lowest price on the web, but lowest among any dealers I had ever heard of. Read dealer reviews; there are lots of horror stories.We live in suburban Dallas and placed the order for this TV with Amazon at 11:30 AM on 2/20, with an estimated delivery date 2/26 - 2/28, and received notice at 4:09 PM that same day that it had shipped. Tracking the shipment showed it was actually picked up in Cincinnati at noon, departed there at 8:00 PM, and arrived in Dallas on 2/22 at 11:21 AM.We were called that day by Eagle to arrange delivery for Saturday morning 2/24, and when I hesitated (due to a full schedule), they offered Friday afternoon. My wife, on the phone at the time, and I both jumped at that chance. The TV arrived and was set in place in our house at 4:15 PM on 2/23. I had the guys wait a few minutes while I verified it worked, then they were on their way.Sorry for the long story, but consider:* Great TV* Great Price* Great Service, with free shipping!What's not to like??? Great job, Amazon!

review_title: Great Television!!
review_text: When our old television died on us about 10 days ago, we went out shopping for a new set. We compared plasma and LED sets. However, we were really struck by the picture, color, and overall quality of this 50" LED set when we compared it to other similar makes and models. Also, we got a great deal on the set from the store we bought it from. After making the purchase, we had the set delivered and installed in our home just a couple of days ago. I can't begin to tell you how happy we've been. The picture has such great quality that I almost feel that the people on television are standing in the room with us. It's also nice to have a bigger screen compared to our previous television which was only 35". The bigger screen is a welcome addition and adds so much more to watching television and enjoying movies at home. Also, the sound quality is great as well. The built-in speakers project sound really well into the room. Overall, we are very pleased with our purchase and love our new television from Samsung. It has proven to be a perfect choice for our home.

review_title: Samsung LNT4665F - Excellent TV
review_text: I purchased this LNT4665F just over a month ago and I am very pleased with it. I had difficulty deciding betweeen this model, the LNT4661, and the new 120Hz LNT4671F, but I am very pleased with my choice. The LNT4671F was $500 more, and I felt the only advantage was brighter colors. I don't see any pixel blurring with my LNT4665F, which the 120Hz feature of the LNT4671F is supposed to improve. I actually had to turn down the brightness and contrast of my LNT4665F as it was more than I needed for our living room.Regarding LNT4665F vs the LNT4661, and after seeing them side-by-side at BestBuy, it was a no brainer for me. One reason I chose the LNT4665F instead is because the LNT4661 is an older generation, and for only $70 more, I was able to get this next generation Samsung (basically meaning darker blacks and better contrast). One concern I had with the LNT4665F before I purchased it was the glossy screen, whereas the LNT4661 has a matte finish. Some reviewers claim the LNT4665F is too shiny, and maybe it is for a living room with a lot of light. I would say my living room has average to slightly higher than average ambient light, as well as overhead canned lights, but the only time I notice the reflection is when I am purposefully trying to notice the reflection on dark scenes. If you have a lot of light and you want virtually zero reflection, go with the LNT4661. However, if you want darker blacks and a crisper picture, go with the LNT4665F. I also think the LNT4665F looks nicer when turned off because of its glossy screen and housing.The only downside of this TV, and it is a very small downside, is the speakers. They are on the bottom side of TV, and with my tilting mount, they face my wall, causing the sound quality to be lower than it should. However, I have a keen ear for sound quality and most may not be able to tell the difference -- my wife doesn't. That said, with a surround sound system, it doesn't matter.Thanks,Matt

review_title: Our First Digital TV
review_text: We finally decided to take the plunge and get a digital TV. We're only getting digital/HD signals over-the-air (OTA) because we're not ready to upgrade to an HD satellite receiver or HD DVD/Blue Ray DVD player. But since reception of analog TV in our area is horrible it's nice to be able to get a clear picture with the digital broadcasts. Now we can watch the local channels that Dish Network doesn't carry.We decided on the LNT-4061F for it's size, features and price (got a "Black Friday" door buster deal). We have limited space for a wide-screen TV in our entertainment center so a 40" was about as big as we could fit. It's perfect for the distance we sit from the TV (about 8 feet). We like all of the input options, especially the ones for legacy systems since we don't have any HDMI components yet. But we wanted a "future proof" set because we plan on keeping it for 10+ years. We currently don't get any 1080p signals but at least this unit will be able to display them when we do.Features we like best:* Great picture on OTA digital signals.* Great viewing angle, almost as good as a CRT TV.* VGA PC input.* 2 S-Video and composite video inputs* 2 Component video inputs* 3 HDMI inputs (for future use)* Optical audio output (to send 5.1 audio to A/V receiver)* USB input for showing pictures and playing MP3 music.Things we are disappointed with:* Only fair quality on non-digital sources (like most digital TVs)* None of the listed remote control codes work on our DISH Networksatellite receiver.* Remote control cannot operate an A/V Receiver* Cannot custom name input options (must select from a list)* Cannot directly access input options, you have to scroll through all of the inputs that have something connected even if the connected component is off.* No video outputs (to record directly from the TV)* Mute icon appears when you mute the sound, won't go away until you un-mute. I did find out how to do an internal mute but you have to go through the setup menu to turn in off and on.* The Picture In Picture (PIP) feature sucks! It can only be used to view analog TV in a sub picture while viewing Component, HDMI or PC source. Can't understand why you can't view another source (like S-video) while watching OTA digital channel??? You also can't swap the main picture with the sub picture, however you can view both pictures side by side. But it's only useful if you want to watch an analog TV tuner source. Makes the PIP feature practically useless.One thing to consider when getting a flat panel TV to replace an old CRT TV is that you can't put your old center speaker on top of the TV anymore because it's too big. Also, fast action video can look blurry, especially when the camera pans back and forth. This seems to be common as we noticed it when looking at other LCD TVs. Supposedly this is mitigated with 120HZ refresh rate but we were'nt willing to fork over an extra $400 for this feature (seeSamsung LNT4069 40" 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV). But after watching for a few days it doesn't seem to be as noticeable anymore. It's kind of like when we first brought home our 32" CRT TV and noticed the tiny black lines that didn't show on our 19" TV. Eventually we got used to it and it didn't bother us anymore.Since this is our first Digital TV we're generally satisfied because we got a smoke'n deal. The limitations of the universal remote is a big draw back for us since we thought it would be able to control our satellite receiver. But at least our Sat. receiver's remote can control the TV so we'll be able to live with it.Update: After a couple of years we noticed that there is major burn-in on the screen after watching a program in 3:4 format. Even after only a couple of hours the side bars get temporarily burnt in. Fortunately these go away eventually. I'd recommend getting something with burn-in protection after this experience.

review_title: Amazing TV. Eagle delivered just fine.
review_text: I never was in two minds about the Samsung LNT4661. My only worry was if Eagle will deliver on time and hassle free. Read some reviews from others who had issues and was concerned a bit. But they delivered 6 days ahead of the posted date on the website. Even unwrapped the TV and set it up for me. The TV itself is AWESOME. I bought it for 1479 on Dec27th and see that it went up a little bit. The only thing better in the market in this price range is Sony for a few hundreds more.

review_title: could use better wifi reception
review_text: great picture and color. wifi reception is weak and won't play most hidef movies for more than 10-15 minutes at a time, sometimes less. most action sequences are okay but there's a LOT of pixilation on close-up, live action, panning shots. I've tried different "action" settings but it doesn't seem to help very much. built in speakers are sufficient for tv shows but woefully inadequate for movies. 240 blurr reduction doesn't seem to reduce the blurring.

review_title: Great HDTV!
review_text: This is my second Samsung HDTV. I have a 3 year-old 56" DLP that is still working fine. The new LCD makes a much better picture, very high contrast and detail, at less than half the cost. The picture was so bright that I had to turn it down. It is connected to our DishTV HDTV box via a 50' component cable. The very good looking swivel stand and small black frame are nice, but hiding the speakers in back slightly compromised the sound quality compared to my old TV. A little hollow sounding. That minor fault aside, this HDTV just jumped out and said buy me when I went to local video stores and made side by side comparisons. Amazon's price was by far the best. And even the wife loves it.

review_title: Great Features but limited Performance
review_text: This Samsung TV has a lot features like 3D, Smart TV, USB ports to play your media files, etc. But the performance is very limited. To start with, the picture does not look great with the default settings. There are tons of settings available to tweak and make your picture look great. But trust me, its not easy. I have been playing around with it for almost 3 weeks now and still I am not very satisfied. The bad part is I know that this TV can really give the best picture quality but unfortunately as a customer, it is really very difficult to set up the tv to get the best picture out of it. The same applies for 3D as well, the set up is a pain. Coming to the smart TV, it has loads of options available but the performance is very slow and you need to wait for a few seconds after clicking on the icons. A couple of times the tv just hung when you click the buttons faster in the remote. All in all, this is a tv with great features but limited performance.

review_title: Tons of small things+Overall great quality=Great buy
review_text: Being a college student, money can be tight, so if I want to spend this much on a TV, I have to make sure I'm spending my money right. Let me tell you, this is just one TV that even after you've read all the reviews, you still won't know all the little "niceties."First off, my basis for using and reviewing this TV is from normal TV (the built in tuner can find local HD channels, which are amazing!) and Xbox 360 w/ HDMI hook up. TV wise, the picture is great and the provided clicker is very easy to use and very comfortable. Xbox is absolutely amazing! Whether it's Call of Duty 4, Assassin's Creed, or Guitar Hero my jaw stays dropped. One thing I've found put about guitar hero is that if you play it on other present 32" LCD models, there can be some "lag" were what you're seeing can be slightly off course. With this TV, there is virtually no lag and the response time is very efficient. Which brings me to the small thing.1) One feature that helps with this "lag" is were right in the menu (which is very clear and can be understood by someone who has never programmed a TV before...me) is a game mode. It's a nice touch.2) Also, the TV always up to four preset picture settings (Sports, Standard, Movie, and preference) all of which can be customized by you. The button for this feature sits right at the top of the clicker and always you to easily switch between the different modes.3) Right next to the Pic Mode setting is the Pic Size that allows the user to switch between Natural, Theater Wide 1, 2, and 3, Full, 4:3HD and Native. Once again, this makes it very easy to switch between the different modes and the native is a nice touch for the xbox games so you can see the whole screen including the captions.4) The TV remebers the main places you switch to and from and these can all be found by pressing the "fav" button and it takes you to different sets (ie: inputs, channels, history, and a slot of 5 user-chosen favorites)5) Even the Mute button is nice offering a 1/2 mute and then a full mute.6) There's a feature that allows controlled volume. An example of this application would be how everynow and then, when changing back from DVD to TV, the volume can blow you away, or how one channel is louder than anouther...This keeps this from happening.7) THE MENU: it's extremely easy to use and the format makes it so I could efficently navigate it within a couple days.8) Power on time is about three seconds from hitting the power button on the clicker (with power save mode off)The only compliant I could even come up with would MAYBE be the sound. Now, the normal TV sound is great; it's only during loud action scenes in movies or the bass on Guitar Hero that I noticed some "white noise" like sounds (keep in mind VERY MINOR) I just hooked up my Logitech X230 computer speakers after buying an $8 adaptor and the sound/bass is amazing. **Keep in mind, I tend to be a stickler for sound so this problem might not be a problem for the TV watcher, or the normal person. however, if you are like me, the speakers I got on Amazon for $30 and only $8 for adaptors make an awesome surround sound imitation**Overall, if I could do it again, I would still go with the 32HL67U. If i had to recomend a TV to a friend/family member, i would suggest the 32HL67U. It's a win-win senario with a very resonable price.Do yourself a favor, stop reading reviews and make it happen.

review_title: Nice smart tv
review_text: I don't have anything to compare this smart tv to as this is my first one, but I am enjoying it. The picture is very bright and the colors look great, I did have a problem with dark scenes being too dark and I had to make the backlight brighter and it fixed the problem. The smart features work well, I do wish that there were more local tv channel apps though. Sometimes the smart feature gets stuck and I have to switch back to regular tv to reset itself, but this doesn't happen often enough to make me want to ditch the tv. Overall I'm quite pleased with it.

review_title: The most bang for your buck!
review_text: When it comes to getting the most for my buck, I'll spend the extra time looking for the best deal around. Money does not come easy these days as we all know. This TV is kick butt for the price, only one thing would make it even better is the sound but now days everyone I know hooks up to a system. Easy to hook up, got the XBox One and PS4 locked down, sound bar. Games are amazing on both systems and the fact that my Galaxy Tab 3 connects so easy, what more could you want! Samsung really hit it out of the park with this TV.

review_title: Happy with Samsung 5687W
review_text: It took about 3 weeks to receive the TV, but delivery was in good condition and they were helpful in upacking. The quality of the TV is excellent, I don't know how I've gone without HD for so long. I had to call my cable company for help with setup, apparantly the Brighthouse HD box didn't have the programming for 1080p, so we had to change some settings. Hopefully they'll have the upgraded software for 1080p soon. My only afterthought: I debated between the 56 and 61 Samsung and now I wish I would have purchased the the 61. The cost was just $300 more and would have been worth the difference. But I'm very happy with the TV.

review_title: worthless brand
review_text: I purchased a Samsung Lcd Tv in June 2008. It looked great ,the picture quality was great. However a week before Christmas it would not power up . No picture no sound . I called Samsung and they said take it in for service. The diagnosis was bad lcd screen , probably bad circuit board. The cost of repair is more than the cost of a new tv. I paid 699.00 for this set and now it is worthless. There are so many complaints on the same issue with Samsung tvs . I wish there was some remedy for this but the only recourse is to spread the word dont buy Samsung..They will not stand behind their product after one year!

review_title: Triumph of design over usability
review_text: Expensive piece of junk. Be prepared to spend several hundred dollars on an external sound system to hear different TV channels. Remote poorly designed. Even in daylight difficult to see which end is up. Stand is very inconvenient if you're trying to move TV to plug something in the back. Getting to videos on an external hard drive is difficult. Does NOT support all video types. Need an external box for that. Switching between inputs requires a quick hand, pulldown only lasts for several seconds. Can get to online streaming video company via a dedicated marked button on remote. That's the reason I bought it. It did take several weeks of debugging, with several calls to tech support. My unit kept insisting I did not have an account and had to signin via remote every time. Eventually the problem stopped.

review_text: I purchased this TV for my office and never used it for one year because no one at the office had time to watch TV. We started using it occasionally during lunch time/ breaks for 1 year, it started making clicking sounds when we tried to turn it on. I called samsung and they asked for model number and when I told them they immediately responded by offering to repair one time for free. They took my information and told me service tech will contact me to schedule a repair. No one called for one month. I called again and they said they assumed I had fixed the problem myself. When I told them I had this problem with TV, they were very familiar with it and again took down my information. Do I think they will fix my TV by next month?Well all I can say is SAMSUCK!

review_title: no picture after 16 months
review_text: Still has audio but no picture. I expect a $2,000+ set to work for many years not just 16 months. The LCD has to be replaced for a parts cost of $1,800 and a service cost of $300. This amounts to the cost of a new TV set. The set is 4 months out of warrenty. I will not be purchasing another Samsung LCD set. Very disappointed in Samsung quality.

review_title: Initial impressions
review_text: After doing alot of price comparison, bang for your buck type stuff, I initially chose the 40" but my order got declined due to a 1000$ limit on my Master Card debit card. So, I submitted it directly through my bank account and Amazon didn't even attempt to process it and just canceled the order, dissapointing. That's when I busted out the AMEX, called them and authorized the amount(gotta love 24/7 c/s) and went ahead and ordered the 46".That was all done on Tuesday 02/19. Last night around midnight, much to my suprise, I saw that Eagle USA(www.cevalogistics.com now) had picked up my shipment in DALLAS at the Amazon warehouse at 3:45pm on 2/21 but had a delivery date of 2/29. Confused I called them at 1.800.888.4949 at 4am and they answered! They said they had picked it up from the Amazon warehouse and it was now in the Eagle warehouse in Grapevine, 6 freaking miles from my house. The rep said they were open 24/7 and I could even pick it up, so off I went.The building had a big E-G-L blue sign on it, so was kinda hard to find. Went through security and to the docking bay, gave them my tracking # and ID and they went with a forklift and got my TV. He said it was brand new and they had JUST gotten the shipment in, package was in great condition with absolutely no blimeshes so I didn't even bother opening it. Strapped it in my truck and took it home. It was almost too heavy to carry in, akward box, but I got it.After unboxing it and examining its exterior for roughly 40 minutes I only found one blemish, probably during manufacturing but not caused by Amazon or EGL, a small scratch on the top of the bezel. Invisible if your not looking for it, but merit enough to mention. The screen was in prestine condition scratch wise, just a bit of dirt/smudge on the topright that easily wiped off.Upon turning it on I spent another 40 minutes searching for dead pixels, discoloration, clouding, or any signs of defect, none were found. I didn't have an antenna yet, getting one tonight, so didn't get to scan for signals so I can't say what that is like yet. Going through the initial setup was painful, the menus are so painfully slow it makes you not want to even calibrate the color/contrast/brightness/etc. Calibration is requied, especially in "Game mode" as it looks horrible until you adjust the settings.I haven't finished calibrating it yet, but so far I'm extremely impressed. The level of detail, with 1080p HDMI, over my 24" Dell 2405fpw in Lost Odyssey is amazing(720p over component). In the beginning of the game lava pours down from the sky, with the Samsung I can see every single person on the battlefield running away from it, never even noticed them on the Dell. Playing COD4 on PS3 is just as rewarding, especially sitting only 6 feet back, it's like having my own theatre. Not even going to comment on the sound, if you got the money to spend on this tv you shouldn't be using it's built in speakers. I use Onkyo 5.1 system, sounds good enough for my room. In our living room we have a 720p HD70 Optoma projector that we sit about 12 feet back from, sitting back 6 feet from the Samsung is roughly equivalent for realestate size for the screens, and it is every bit as enthralling. A real cenematic experience, I am happy with my purchase and definately reccomend it.The entire purchase was a good experience, no delivery horror stories. But, I was definately weary and was glad I was able to pick up the TV myself, was a relief. If anyone in the DFW plans on purchasing this TV, good chances are you can pick it up yourself the very next day at the warehouse. After I've had it a while I'll write another review.

review_title: Great TV, great seller.
review_text: Bought the last year Samsung model LN 4095 and the TV picture died after three days. Returned to Amazon and got a full refund. I was very happy with this model already.Bought a Sharp as a replacement and it was no match to the Samsung. Then found out Samsung has this new model and I bought it from Amazon right away. This one is even better than the LN 4095 with more features and more inputs. One big surprise, it even decode some of the digital HD channels from my analog cable. I've never seen so many channels before. So far, my only complain is the sound is not as good as advertise. The SRS sounded plain, not much sound effect. Bottom line, the best TV I've ever owned.

review_title: Very nice image and features.
review_text: In a bright room the picture is very visible with excellent 'pop' in 'vivid' mode. When the room dims a dedicated remote button makes it easy to choose a softer image setting with better gray scale tracking and depth. In a dark room the black level is clearly visible as a dark grey. Pretty dark blacks for an LCD set but can't match a plasma for dark room blacks.I like the matte screen of the 4061 model. Glare is not a problem in my frequently bright room. You never feel like it's a mirror.The set is very thin at 3" and the rear inputs are recessed allowing me to use a 1" thick wall mount without crushing the connectors.You can attach a USB memory stick with still pictures and the set will display them pretty well. It's cool but not full 1080p resolution and the big jpeg images from current digicams take maybe 5 seconds to appear after selected. Pretty slow. An HDMI output DVD player with card reader should work much better.Sound is OK for a TV. You need external speakers if you want sound to come anywhere close to complementing the outstanding HD picture.

review_title: Simply a very solid choice
review_text: Ok, so I bought this thing from Amazon.com on December 28, 2007 and it found itself in my home about a week or so later. Before I talk about the TV itself, a word on the shipping. This was one of the most unique shipping experiences I have had for a product such as this. Normally for things like furniture and appliances, you have someone come in and install everything for you and make sure everything is cool. Well, assuming Amazon still has it, you get that same type of service with this TV...for free!!! The guy came into my house, unpacked my TV, put it together, and stuck around to ensure that the TV was not defective and in working order. No offense to UPS, as they are great, but you won't get that service from them. Anyhow, on to the TV.Wow! I agonized over my decision to get a TV because it is obviously a costly investment and you don't want to screw it up and have to go through the trouble of undoing it. I was basically set on Samsung's LN-T3253H, but I had a bit of trouble agreeing on the price that retailers such as Best Buy, Circuit City, and even Amazon.com wanted me to pay for it. So I searched past the letter 'S' and went on to 'T' to find this diamond in the rough. The price was very right and it consistently scored over a 4.5 on all the websites I visited. After going to the store to look at it side by side with that aforementioned Samsung, I wasn't quite sold....until an hour later. I want you to be very careful when choosing a TV that is very bright and pretty. Initially it looks nice, ala the LN-T3253H, but after looking at this one some more, I saw that it does the color black extremely well. Something I thought was questionable on the Samsung. As a matter of fact, the full spectrum looks very well done as the contrast between the color is very vivid and believable. While Toshiba does not list the contrast ratio of this set, it's easy to see that it is very good. Also, this TV comes with all the ports you will need for today's current applications.There are 3 HDMI ports, 1 composite AV input, 2 component input, 1 audio output, a digital audio output, 1 S-video input, an antenna input, and a PC input, which has become one of my favorites. If you hook your computer or even your laptop up to this, you will be amazed by the picture quality and probably would not want to use your main screen again. The sound, while not jaw dropping, is good/very good. Of course, hooked up to a sound system and it all sounds verrry nice. Coupled with a very good to almost great looking HD picture and you have a TV that does what it is supposed to do at this price point very well. Of course, standard def broadcasts and media takes a little hit in quality, but if you sit far enough back, it actually looks better than the 4:3 aspect ratio TV you had prior...at least in my case. I could go on here, but that would bore you. Bottom line is that this is one of the best, if not the best 32 inchers on the market. You could go with Sony, and by all means, if you are willing to spend the extra cash do so, but that would not be necessary as this TV is just as capable as any Sony 32 inch you can buy. I got mine for $684 directly from Amazon. The price has gone up since then, but I think that it is still worth it. Pay with your platinum Visa/Mastercard and you should be able to double the manufacturer's warranty. Same with American Express (check your card member agreements to make sure). Buy with confidence and sit back and enjoy!

review_title: Regarding shipping
review_text: I'm a little confused in regards to previous review on shipping. The guy states the TV was shipped on Dec 31, and he will be getting it on Jan 9th..that's 6 business days..what's the problem? Amazon gives an estimated arrival date, and I bet it was right around the 9th. Sounds like this guy saw that it reached Vegas on the 3rd and disregarded the arrival date thinking he would get it sooner. No one has any patience these days it appears.

review_title: Nice TV, great price and delivery
review_text: Having it for a month now, so far so good. I decided to buy a 1080p TV from the beginning, as it is the standard for the foreseeable future, in the coming digital media world. I choose for Samsung T4661F based on the quality and price after reading many online reviews.The TV is great, just as described from many reviews. Went to Bestbuy yesterday to look it again among other 46-47" LCD TVs, and still happy with my choice. The matte screen does reduce the contrast and dark detail a little bit comparing to 4665, 4671, and Sony, but is the right choice for our bright living room.The on TV speakers are average. Without a sound system, I plugged in a subwoofer to boost the base, and can feel the improvement. Heard the digital audio output can not pass 5.1sound, which is a minus, although I am not using it for the moment.Connecting to my laptop and it is a great monitor for watching pictures, movies and play games. I do need to use the VGA port (or HDMI port, not tested) to get full HD resolution, the S-video only support up to 1024x768 resolution.The response time of the TV to the remote is a bit slow, but acceptable.Amazon has the best price, and I have got $130 refund due to price reduction with in the month I having the TV. $500 less than Bestbuy. I have also got a free universal remote and expecting a $100 NFL certificate as part of the deal.The delivery experience was better than expected. The unit came a few days early than Amazon's estimate, arrived 7 days after ordering. Two persons show up on time and set the TV up on the TV stand, turned it on with the remote and allowed my to inspect throughly before sign the paperwork.

review_title: Here's why I bought this, here's why I'm even happier now.
review_text: I'm the guy everyone in my family comes to for product advice, so hopefully my story will help people if they're on the fence. Most of the decision points are the same as other reviews, but here's how I came to my conclusion, and the unbelievable bonus that makes the purchase even better than I could have hoped.Do I pay extra for 1080p? In the end I voted yes for this. Why? Because at my core I'm a tech guy. I may cheap out when buying certain clothes or pack my own lunch, but when it comes to technology, I want to be ahead of the curve. I buy extra ram for my computer so it will take longer to become obsolete, and the same goes for getting the newer technology for my TV.LCD vs. Plasma: I'm a huge sports guy so this one was tough for me. But in the end, I decided that the blurring on fast sports was probably imperceptible (I was right), I read some real stories about burn in, and I wanted the option to hook up my laptop if I wanted.Brand: Sony is too expensive, and I eliminated the lower models like Philips, LG, etc, and went between Samsung and Sanyo. For this, I looked at them side by side in the store, and the Samsungs were just brighter and crisper.4665 vs. 4661: Because I had been leaning somewhat toward a plasma, I went with the 4665 because it was brighter, more "glass-like" in appearance, and well, performed more like a plasma. I live in a small NYC studio apartment with only 1 window. So while this sucks for natural light, it's a perfect scenario for this TV. Glare is non-existent.40" TV vs. 46" TV: I went back and forth on this, and to be honest, if Samsung had made a 42" like every other brand, I would have probably settled on that. But the guy in the apartment before me had a 47" Vizio in here. What was I supposed to do, go with 40" after that? So even though my last TV was a 30" Toshiba tube HDTV, and the 46" looks somewhat ginormous in my studio, I said what the hell and went with bigger is better. I think the quote that got me was, "I've never met anyone that wished they had gotten a smaller TV, but I know several that regretted not going with a bigger model."Buy local or through Amazon: Well, we tried. My friend and I went to a local retailer here and said if he could come close to the Amazon price, factoring in shipping and tax, we would buy from him (both my buddy and I were buying TVs at the same time). They couldn't come close. Read on for the money factor...Bonus: Here is the tip that you probably didn't know. So not only was the initial price ($2049) lower than the local retailer. And not only was shipping free. And not only was the tax free. And not only did I get multiple $25 gift cards because I used my Amazon credit card.But Amazon has a policy that you can call up unlimited times and get a price reduction if you see a lower price on the product. So I bought my TV for $2049 on Nov 1. A week or so later, it had dropped to $1999 and I called and they credited my account. I set a reminder in my work Outlook to check every day at lunch. It dropped again to $1949. Call. Refund. I definitely made sure to check on Black Friday. And Black Monday. And again. Call. Refund. And again.So in the end for me the price has dropped from $2049 to $1799, saving me $250 off my original price. Oh, and my friend's TV dropped $50, my HD DVD player dropped $10, and even my wall bracket dropped $20.But wait you say, I don't have time to sit on hold all that time. Well, you don't. If you go to Amazon's help page, there is a feature called "Call me now." You type in your phone number and literally 5 seconds later, your phone rings with a live person on the other end, and 2 minutes later you have your savings. And no, I don't work for Amazon. Like I said, I'm the bargain guy, and I know every trick to get a good price. And if one end of the spectrum is creepy commissioned salespeople in Manhattan and the other is a flawless customer experience, it's a no brainer.All this would be irrelevant if the performance didn't live up to the hype. Well, it does. In a word, the TV is stunning. End of story.

review_title: Would be nice if Eagle would just get it here!!!!
review_text: Eagle has got to be one of the dumbest delivery companies around. I purchased this set on Feb. 23rd. As of March 3rd. it has made it's way from Reno, NV to Sacramento ,Ca. A grand total of 132 miles EAST. I live 204 miles SOUTH of Reno!!! HELLO Eagle. Look at a map! From Sacramento it is headed south to Los Angeles. THEN back north to Bishop,Ca. It will have traveled 800 miles before it gets here. It would have been cheaper, and taken less time, to just have one of the employees throw it in the back of a pickup truck and drive it down here.Eagle gets a BIG "F" for delivery. This will be the LAST item I purchase from Amazon that requires a truck to deliver.

review_title: Failed after 16 months. Don't buy!
review_text: We bought this Samsung LCD Television (mode LN-T4661F) on February 15, 2008 from Amazon.com for $1,624.99. Starting in June of 2009 our television has been displaying strange patterns when we turn it on, or part of the screen won't display at all. We called the warranty telephone number and they wouldn't help me because it's past the 1-year warranty. I've emailed customer support, but they won't return my emails.I think it's absolutely unacceptable that a $1,600 television would fail after 16 months. We bought Samsung because we thought it was a good television brand.DON'T BUY THIS TELEVISION!!

review_text: Performs above our expectations. Beautiful picture, very easy to use menus and decent sound quality. If we have one drawback that would be the stand, just looks a little strange with the tv being so large, but that's more of a personal taste than a real issue. We have Samsung tv's, dvd players, microwave, range and our fridge just quit on us, (which is not a Samsung), so we our going to purchase a Samsung fridge this weekend. Can't go wrong when you go Samsung.

review_title: Great LCD!
review_text: After doing a lot of research and looking at all the local LCD's on display, I chose the Samsung 4661. This LCD has met all my expectations and is a good looking LCD even when it is not on. My ONLY complaint with the LCD is the shiny black trim. At night a do have some glare due to my table lamps reflecting off of the shiny black trim, I would prefer it to be a flat black. The purchase through Amazon was perfect. As the price has dropped over the past few weeks, Amazon has credited my credit card with the price difference. My only complaint I have is that it took about 2 weeks to get the TV, but that is really no issue. Due to the fact that the white glove delivery only came to my city once a week tacked on another 7 days for it to be delivered, but the whole transaction was easy and I am very satisfied with the LCD and Amazon. Don't hesitate to buy this LCD and to buy it through Amazon. Hesitation will only lead to additional days you don't have this fantastic LCD.

review_title: Glued to the TV. Here what I have to say about the 3d!
review_text: Wow! My quest is over. I just purchased the 46 inch UN46F6400 and I must honestly say that I do not regret my purchase one bit. Ok, I wish I could have afforded to buy a larger screen, but I'm still very happy with the 46 inch. I researched 3d HDTVs for months after getting a demonstration from a friend of the TV's capabilities. He purchased a similar Samsung 3D HDTV and blew me away with what I saw. I was stunned by the picture quality and equally stunned at the quality of the 3D. Years ago I had seen a demostration of a 3D rear projection HDTV and I wasn't impressed by the quality of the 3D. Boy, times have sure changed. My research of 3D HDTVs included all of the major popular brands and I even watched all of the CNET reviews online for all of the HDTVs. The 3D quality of this HDTV is STUNNING! I mean it! STUNNING! On numerous occasions I caught myself ducking to avoid 3D objects hurtling my way from the screen! Stunning picture quality and stunning 3D. Well worth the purchase! When paired with a Samsung 3D Blu Ray player be prepared to see some stunning HD picture quality! Please note that the 2d-3d converson is so-so, but hey, its not real 3D. Look, if you want to watch 3D then watch it in 3D. 2d-3d is basically a gimmick. The Smart TV apps are great but I will be purchasing a wireless keyboard because on screen keyboard is a hassle to use with the remote.

review_title: Very pleased...
review_text: I purchased the 40V3000 directly from Amazon purely because of the price and the fact that it was a Sony. I paid $1201 with free shipping, all other stores were offering this unit on sale at $1699. I could not find a better TV with the same options and size for less than $1400. The overall quality of this TV is fantastic, even without HD. Colors are true, picture is sharp and the sound is awesome. When we first hooked it up to our SD Directv dish the picture was a little fuzzy, found out that the RF type cable I was using between the TV and DTV box was junk. Switched to RCA type cables and the picture improved. Today, we are adding HD from DTV and all the cables and boxes are being replaced. I cant imagine a picture better than what we already have. My only advice is to watch the price at Amazon, I have seen it go as low as $1201 (which is what we paid) to a high of $ 1548 in a one week period. Shipping was extremely fast. I ordered on Sunday expecting it to ship monday from PA. We were contacted on Tuesday saying the TV was in the local Boston warehouse and ready for delivery. The unit was delivered Wednesday afternoon by Eagle Freight. The driver told us that delivery included unpacking the unit and plugging it it to make sure it work and was not damage. Overall, great TV and great price and service from Amazon...

review_title: Great Product, and expect it to continue
review_text: Just purchased. Great display, but still can see minor distortions. I'm a video engineer and can get over this. After some tweaking on sound and video everything is great and meets my demanding expectations. Using a Samsung sound bar but one issue is not being about to control the volume with the TV remote using the Digital out of the TV. major oversight. The Dig Out has different Audio features that are useless without volume control from the TV. Ok if you connect to Surround sound, but not the soundbar. Lots of options and features. Simple setup menu for cable box setup and guide configuration. Meets my tough minimums and highly recommend.

review_title: highly pleased
review_text: I purchased this tv a little over a week ago. The picture quality is outstanding except when you are watching blu-ray movies with a lot of motion in the background. In this instance you get some tracing effects, but I understand that that is a problem with all lcds, and sony has minimized the amount of this compared to other name brands. I went to sams, circuit city, bset buy, and did all kinds of research online. This tv was the best picture that I could afford, and i got a great deal on it. The tv speakers are outstanding as well, they almost sound as good as my surround sound system. My biggest complaint is the remote this tv comes with. If you are shelling out over a 1000 dollars for a tv, I really feel that you should get a universal remote. Also, there is no easy setup on the remote for the Pip. I think that I will use the old remote that came with my previous sony tv, b/c it has the pip easy access, and is a universal remote. Overall I am extremely happy with my purchase, I really thought that i was going to be disappointed because I have always been more of a tube tv fan, even though they are heavy, I got an awesome picture from my 1080i Sony that just shut down. Very pleasantly surprised.

review_title: Not Disappointed
review_text: Received this TV in late May. First big ticket item purchased thru Amazon, so I was a little nervous. Encountered a little snag with Eagle shipping, was sitting in their warehouse and not delivered. Called Amazon and they were more than helpful, even credited my credit card for $50 for the inconvenience. Shortly after delivery, price drop at Amazon resulted in another $102 credit to my credit card. As for the TV, the picture is better than I even imagined. HD is incredible, and with my digital cable, even non HD TV is much better than I was led to believe it would be on other forums. I'd recommend this TV as the best bang for the buck, and I'd also recommend Amazon without hesitation.

review_title: Sony - YES! Eagle Delivery Service - NO!!!
review_text: The TV? It is absolutely fabulous! We now have two Sony LCD TVs and I wouldn't dream of buying anything else. Also, between the time we purchased the TV and the time it was delivered the price went down, and Amazon very happily credited me the difference. I was so taken with all the reviews that said Eagle would bring in the TV and plug it in to be sure it worked! NOT! In fact, the driver of the truck was so scared of the public road to our house that my husband had to go meet them and ask them to come with him to be sure it worked. The driver said there was no way they do that - even tho the dispatcher who had scheduled the delivery said that they would. Never again would I buy anything that used Eagle.

review_title: So far I like it
review_text: Samsung LNT4061F 40" 1080p LCD HDTVI have look into these type of TVs for long time and maybe for $200 more I should have got the LNT4071F, but in average there is no difference. The TV and Amazon have been fantastic, shop for the best price and incentives and buy it. I did recommend my nephew and he bought the 4661, I am still waiting my commission from Amazon (joke).One negative, the remote needs to redesign in size and key locations. I turn off the TV often because the OFF key is same size and too close to the # 1.

review_title: Don't buy this t.v.!
review_text: I have the same problem with the horizontal lines going across the screen and the blurry picture that I keep reading about all over the internet. The tv is not even 2 years old. It is out of warranty. Samsung doesn't care that it is an obvious defect. They said they don't pay attention to what people on the internet say about their products. I was going to pay to have it fixed but after reading reviews from people that have done this it sounds like a bad idea. So I am going to buy either the Sony LED t.v. or the sony LCD XBR t.v. and just accept the fact that I threw away [...] on a piece of junk t.v. that lasted less than 2 years

review_title: DO NOT BUY THIS TV
review_text: I purchased this TV 18 months ago thru Amazon, it is now broken (picture failed) and out of warranty. This TV got rave reviews from many sites in the beginning but if you do your research you will find hundreds of complaints that this TV fails about 1 year to 18 months in - which is naturally outside of warranty and Samsung refuses to acknowledge the problem! Unless you always pruchase an extended warranty with Samsung I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN as I just threw away $1700.00!!!

review_title: Some speed bumps, but an overall smooth ride
review_text: TV shipped one day after I ordered it, arrived two days later, with a crack in the frame. The shipping company took it back and I called Amazon to send out a replacement. One week later, no TV. It turns out that the replacement request never went through! However, the customer service that Amazon provided to fix this problem was beyond anything I have ever gotten from any other company.As soon as the mistake was acknowledged, a replacement was shipped out and delivered promptly. The white glove service was great. They were going to deliver between 3 and 7. They called my cell phone at exactly 3pm, to tell me they were outside. Great testing of the set and they did not leave until I told them the set was good.The TV itself is gorgeous. The size is perfect and the clarity is unbeatable. I immediately connected it to my Playstation 3 Blu-ray player, and the jaw dropping picture and sound blew me away.Very impressed and I highly recommend it. It's well worth the money and will not disappoint.

review_title: No Dolby Digital
review_text: After much research and having had good luck with Samsung TVs before, I decided on this model. The picture was good from directly in front of the screen, but suffered while viewing from off-angles. The major problem with the unit was the lack of Dolby Digital while using an HDMI source. I tried to connect the TV to the surround receiver (using the SPDIF optical output on the back of the TV) but PCM stereo was the only audio format option. Dolby Digital and DTS were "grayed out" and not available to be chosen when using any format, including HDMI, other than a coaxial line. Surprising that this TV would be engineered to not allow Dolby Digital as an audio format coming from HDMI since that's the latest and most efficient method of hooking up an HD cable box to the TV. This was a deal breaker for me, as this TV was to be the central unit of a home theater system. I had to send the TV back and move my old LNT4671F back into the room.

review_title: Great TV
review_text: I just purchased this TV to add as my 4th samsung TV in my house. Unfortunately after 1 week of owning it, the whole screen had to be replaced because of a bad LED. Fortunately, samsung was able to get it fixed by my local authorized samsung repair center promptly. My only reservation is that samsung did not simply replaced the whole tv. Otherwise, great product.

product_name: Samsung HL-S4666W 46-Inch DLP HDTV
review_score: 4
review_title: Exceeded Expectations
review_text: Yesterday, my Samsung HL-S4666W DLP HDTV was delivered to my home by super-saver shipping exactly 11 days after it was ordered. (I live a considerable distance from the nearest large city, hence the extra days) The TV worked amazingly well right out of the box. I connected it to my outdoor antenna and immediately began to receive clear, sharp, over-the-air HDTV broadcasts from our local repeater (translater) station. After a few minor adjustments to contrast, brightness, and tint, to suit my personal preferences, I was ready to go. Next, I connected my progressive-scan DVD player through the S-video input, popped in a DVD, and was impressed by what I saw on the screen.Having noticed that the price of the HL-S4666W had dropped between the time I placed the order and when it was shipped, I contacted Amazon customer service to request a credit for the difference. They promptly and courteously responded to my request, and indicated that a credit would indeed be applied to my VISA account.I, like most individuals contemplating the purchase of a relatively expensive consumer electronics item, have paid close attention to user opinions and feedback, and accordingly, had been somewhat alarmed by a few of the comments regarding the quality of this product and its performance, as well as Amazon's shipping and customer service. All I can say is that my experience thusfar has been entirely positive.

review_title: Almost Perfect
review_text: I have three Samsung LCDs and was replacing one with this LED. I love the Samsung brand and had great expectations - mostly. My only complaint is the picture display in filmed low-light scenes. Sometimes you can barely make out the imagery. And the display flickers and has a hard time adjusting to varying light levels of the show. I have tried all of the energy savings adjustments recommended in the manual and on YouTube but the problem persists. As this is my only LED, I am not sure if this is inherent of the technology, or of this model or unit. Other than that I will always look to Samsung first and recommend to anyone looking for a new TV.

The price dropped a $100 or so per week until the holidays. I ordered just before Xmas for $1480 with free shipping and had it up and running by new year's eve. After the holidays it went back up to $1699. Go figure. Very pleased with the set.

review_title: Samsung Rules - Amazon/Eagle Offers Great Service
review_text: Samsung LNT4665F 46" 1080p LCD HDTVThis 46' Samsung is the best TV that money can buy. I stopped at Circut City & Best Buy in Kansas City on 12/26/07 & the price was $1999.00 on this TV. I quickly drove home and looked at Amazon. WOW!!! THIS EXACT SAME TV WAS ONLY $1599.00 with FREE shipping. I was born at night, but not last night. I ordered it and within 4 days the TV was delivered at my doorstep. The 2 Eagle representives unloaded the TV with a smile and a great attitude.

review_title: Samsung LNT4061F LCD HDTV review
review_text: This is a great TV. This is our first HD TV and we're amazed at the picture we are getting. We don't have cable or satellite, so we only get over the air broadcasts, but the HD broadcasts come in crystal clear. It is very easy to use as well. I compared this product with other brands and I think the cost is very reasonable relative to the quality. I would recommend to anyone.

review_title: My husband is in love--with this TV
review_text: We bought this TV summer 2012 and have enjoyed it with no problems. It was easy to set up to Netflix, although I wish it came up on Netflix instead of Family TV. It may be adjustable, but I don't know how to change the menu setup. I'm sure that I could do even more with the TV if I would take the time to figure things out. we now have access to Closed Captions on most Netflix, which our old blu-ray player did not support. The picture is so gorgeous It sometimes distracts me from the action/plot --"wow, look at that mural on the wall" or "What colors on that hillside". We have 4 windows in the room and no glare. We moved up from a 46" to the 60, and it's great. We bought a sound bar with this TV to combine components so can't comment on the speakers.

review_title: Great For the Price
review_text: This TV is great for the price - but be careful where you order from. My tv finally arrived from amazon today and when the guy took it out of the box there were broken parts visible through the screen! So he had to take it back. Remember that there are places out there that let you return your tv up until 30 days - at amazon they deliver and hook it up - if it works - then after that it is up to you. Breaks on day 2 - you deal with Samsung. Trust me, you DO NOT want to deal with their customer service department, I spent a whole summer attempting to get a different Samsung fixed.Nonetheless, I purchased this tv because 1080p tv's are twice the price and if you want a good tv - wait until 1080p LCD's lower in price down to the 2500k range. Currently they are around 4000k. For the price, you get a decent HDTV that is light and easy to move around. Good buy, just be careful where you buy from.

I checked the price about three week after my purchase and the unit was being offered for $300 less. I sent an E-mail to Amazon. They gave me a $300 credit that same day.

review_title: Joining the chorus of screwed customers...
review_text: Looks like Samsung has produced an absolute lemon, sold it for $2000+ and then 2-3 years later when it dies, they do nothing about it. I have had the same problem with the TV powering off and had it repaired 3 times spending over $500. It died AGAIN last week and I decided to contact Samsung. They refuse to do any kind of repair on a CLEARLY defective TV (capacitor issue it seems). Not even a credit to buy another TV. I will NEVER buy a Samsung TV again!

review_title: Nice TV, but has a design flaw that will cost you!
review_text: I bought my Samsung LN-T4665F about 1 1/2 years ago and it no longer is working. Just after it is out of warranty it started clicking and now, 3 months later, it doesn't work at all! This is happening to several models of Samsung TVs and Samsung is doing nothing to resolve the issue. In fact, there is a class action lawsuit about this ([...]). Please see the following sites before purchasing ANYTHING Samsung:[...]All I can say is BUYER BEWARE! SAMSUNG does not support their products well. The fix for this costs about $10 in parts, but is a $300 service repair to have a tech do it. IT'S NOT WORTH THE RISK!

review_text: The Samsung is a great TV and the price couldn't be beat. But the delivery was poor. It was promised to arrive on or before 12/18, but got stuck at the shippers location in Houstan. I needed to make several calls and Emails with Amazon (yes you can call with some one if you are persistent), their shipper and the shipper's subcontractor to get things moving. It was finally delivered to my door and unpacked in my livingroom at 8:30PM Sunday night 12/22. This part of the deliverly was great.

review_text: I am so happy with this TV. My previous TV was a 20-year-old Sharp with a picture tube, 27". I upgraded to a 43". Once I got it connected to my provider, I just followed the on-screen instructions for set up. It was simple. I adjusted the color, sharpness and so on and the picture is just amazing! The only thing I do not like is that there is some amount of glare depending on the inside lighting, I can deal with that. Money well spent. :)

The controls are easy, the hookups intuitive and the picture and sound are like a theatre. I love it love it love it! And once again I give high marks to Amazon. They make buying big and expensive things on the internet a safe and pleasant experience. I have never been disappointed in Amazon's products or performance.

review_title: Awesome TV!
review_text: I got this TV around Thanksgiving 2007 for a really^2 good deal.I'm very satisfied w/ the product; extremely good picture quality, no dead pixels. I also like grand look of this TV - piano black panel, SRS sounds real, up-converted DVD looks stunning, plenty of custom settings available, though default settings produce great picture quality, Stable Sound works well for cable TV, but I turn it off if I'm gonna watch a DVD.I purchased this based on the technical specifications, Amazon customer reviews and Consumer Report - this TV is one of the 2007 best LCD. I tried to look at the TV at local retailers, but among all LCDs turned on, this TV was turned off ??? I ordered it anyway. Then, b4 the TV arrived, I got the chance to see the TV side by side with Sony. I don't see the difference. Since the panel is piano-black, I can see if the TV produces "real" black or not. Yes, the TV is capable of displaying black quite well. Night scenes are great. Watching 300 (Spartans) on this TV is GREAT!!!This TV has 14-bit digital video processor, and I believe, it outputs 10 bits. What it means is you get more levels/combinations of colors. For example, you will see the orange as orange, not red or yellow. Contrast Ratio? It's got enough to see those night scenes in 300 movie clearly. Blacks are real blacks, not grayish black.Sound - simply great! those virtual surround sound actually works, of course if you sit in front of the TV. 3D sound effects are also great.Size- yes, this TV is a bit bulkier than its competitors. But it's more loaded, technically.Resolution - 720p is enough for a 32" LCD TV because you will not see the difference between 1080p and 720p on a 32" TV from a 6-9 feet distance. But if you gonna go for more than 37", consider 1080p.I compared technical specifications of different TVs in this price range and size. To me, this Toshiba TV seems to be more technically sophisticated. Compared to XBR4, they both have similar video processing power but XBR4 offer 120Hz which is good for sport-fan. Unless you are willing to pay twice, you might wanna get the REGZA.Overall, this TV is of very high value. You get more the bucks.

review_title: Excellent TV
review_text: Excellent TV so far. No drop out on HDMI yet and i'm using the Neusat HD free 2 air SAT only show up to 1080i. No Blueray nor HDDVD player yet :(, but will save money for those. But with 1080i, I already amazed by the its color and brighness display quality. Regular local channels using the little HD antenna @ radioshack 4 $30 show amazing picture too (KCAL9, KTLA5, ABC7...). I've never thought local free channels would look this great before buying this TV.Awesome picture quality. I plug the SD card USB reader into the USB port to view the pictures I took with my Canon SD800 IS and the picture just beautiful. It also plays mp3 file(s) if you have it on the memory card as background music while displaying the slideshow. So forget those 7-10" digital picture frames, this one does the same thing in much much bigger size.PC input great too, very sharp and clear just like a regular monitor. Resolution of 1920x1080 give really really huge space to work with although I would prefer allowance of 1280x768 to make all the display, fonts... bigger so I can surf the web at 10 feet away instead of having to move closer to the TV everytime I'm surfing the web.Overall, very happy with this TV. My wife loves it too, making this buying another win win for me :)

review_text: I was a little nervous about buying an expensive item like this on the internet but everything went very well. The tv was delivered in perfect condition.It was $300 less than Best Buy and Circut City, no taxes (9.25% in Chicago,soon to be 10.25%) and free delivery,it's a no brainer.As far as the product goes its great.Beautiful picture,easy to set up,very good instructions. Only suggestion is to take the tv out of the factory setting,It defaults to dynamic picture setting and its way to bright.Great value and great quality for the price.

review_title: HORRIBLE PRE-SALES CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
review_text: I was comparison shopping for this unit, and wanted to know any significant design variations throughout the product line. Budget vs mid-level vs high-end.So I called Toshiba for clarification. The customer service representative was knowledgeable, and easily answered my questions.I began reading the 32HL67U description, and discovered several specifications for the audio output were overlooked on Toshiba's web site. So, I called Toshiba again for further clarification.This time, I felt like I was playing Stump-the-Dummy. I was amazed the customer service representative couldn't even answer the simple question, "What type of audio out jack is used?" I began to wonder if he could even comprehend what I was asking. So after rephrasing the question several times, I asked to speak with someone else, and stated we (he and I) were not communicating effectively. The customer service representative had the audacity to tell me "I wasn't speaking effectively!" I was completely taken by suprise with his rude comment, but quickly responded with an appropriate reply.The third time I called back to speak with a supervisor. I was denied! The customer service representative stated I would have to divulge my identity and contact information before a supervisor would even consider talking to me. So I gave fictitious information, and was told it wasn't good enough because it didn't "seem" real.In my opinion, Toshiba has deplorable customer service, and this incident definitely cost them my business!A reasonalbe person would have to wonder, if Toshiba's customer service is rude and useless BEFORE the sale, then how bad is it AFTER the sale? ...that is, once they have your money!To be fair, the 32HL67U most likely has some good points, as evidenced by the 5-Star reviews.PS. The audio out is fixed Dolby Digital 5.1 via an optical jack. ;-)Hope this helps!

review_title: excellent purchase experience
review_text: Like many, I toiled over which LCD/PLASMA TV I would purchase for my new "media" room...and where to buy it. For me the best price and value came with Amazon. I love the TV and my purchase went pretty flawlessly. I ordered the TV on 09/27 and it was in my house on the 30th. The delivery guy even called twice to confirm that I would be home and to give a good time to deliver. Great experience with this amazon purchase.
