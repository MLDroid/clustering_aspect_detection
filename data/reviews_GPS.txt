review_title: CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT- BIKE & AUTO
review_text: I've only had 2 problems. #1- it had locked up on me once. I think It was my fault. I placed it on and off the bike then shut it down before it completed it's loading. I just PRESSED & HELD DOWN the + button and the POWER BUTTON at the same time. It rebooted (like a computer). It never happened again. #2- the maps are about 95% - meaning they seem to be somewhat outdated. But, all in all, I can't live or shall I say I'll never live without one. Members are getting them... one at a time. GWRRA BATESVILLE ARKANSAS www.gwrra-ar-h.org

review_text: I always thought about buying a GPS device. After doing some homework and watching prices I made the bold move to purchase one. I'm not sorry, I did. It's a tremendous thing to have in your car. I predict eventually all cars will have them as standard thing when you buy a car. I highly recommend the Garmin Nuvi 350 pocket vehicle GPS navigator and Personal Travel Assistant to anyone. You won't be sorry you did!

review_title: Novice's Review of Garmin 2720
review_text: First off, I'm not one of those reviewers who's tried several GPS systems, or one who will nitpick every little glitch..I'm just a regular guy, a heavy road-travelling service engineerwho lives in New Jersey, and travels every day into upstate New York, Connecticut, Massachussets, and other Terra Non-Firma..I bought the Garmin 2720 on looks and features alone. I've never used a GPS before, but boy, I'm sure glad I bought one now! What a lifesaver. Plugged it in, read the manual for a few seconds, and off I go! Granted, no product is perfect ( I've noticed several little directional glitches, nothing worth whining about), but in my opinion, worth every penny.I feel the text-to-speech feature is about perfect. Just the right amount of audible information at the appropriate intervals. Automotive-grade monitor is excellent, also.Bottom line: If you're thinking about buying the Garmin 2720 andare holding off, go for it! If you're looking for an incredibly useful tool to reduce stress in your daily commute to unknown places, and are looking for an easy-to-use GPS to help you accomplish that, you could do way worse than this unit.

review_title: Amazing Device
review_text: I was torn between Magellan Maestroo 4040 and Garmin nuvi 350. Although Magellan had more features, however the simplicity, quickness and useability of Garmin won me over. The only thing I would wish for the future firmware upgrade to fix would be the "via points". It allows only 1 via point selection while Magellan allows 20. Not a deal breaker as I was always able to retrack my way to the destination as Garmin was quick to recalculate route even if I went on my own.

review_title: Powerful and route is customizable
review_text: I already own the Garmin i5, but decided to buy the 2720 because I wanted to be able to preconfigure my routes with the included mapping software. It is much easier to do so with the mapping software than with the unit itself.The 2720 is very powerful and configurable, but I give it 4 stars because it is:- Bulky, heavy and cumbersome to set up. The i5 that I own is much faster to set up, lighter and more compact. I prefer to use the i5 on short local trips and 2720 for longer routes since I can pre-configure my routes.- The usable area on 2720 screen is not very big. The newer models like Nuvi, c550 have bigger screens.- It seems to be very picky when entering street names. Even when I spell the name correctly, the 2720 sometimes still cannot find it. The i5 software is smarter and usually does not have trouble finding street names.- Uploading routes/via points from PC is extremely slow. The mapping software doesn't upload incremental changes. So if you add a couple of way points, it'll still upload everything you've ever entered.On the plus side:- The full version of the mapping software has more detail than the Lite version that came with i5. For example, the full version has the little roads in a cemetary that I visit annually, but the lite version doesn't.- I don't need to enter an address to go to a particular location. The only requirement is that the location needs to be on a road. So it can't be in the middle of a field with no roads. To do this I simply pick a spot on the street and just tell the 2720 to take me there. The i5 needs an address, but I can get around it by using intersections (not as good though).

review_title: it does the job, but buy a different model
review_text: I have owned this Garmin GPS for about 3 months and it has really helped out alot. I really hate maps and I'm not the most experienced driver, but with the Garmin c530 I am driving like a pro. It's very comforting knowing that I can find my way to a long distant job interview or navigate on busy highways.However, the c530 isn't perfect. The biggest problem (as other reviewers have pointed out) is that this unit doesn't announce street names. Second I have experienced a few glitches. There have been a few times when the unit tells you to turn at the wrong address. Sometimes the unit gets really wacky and the voice says turn right and the screen shows to turn left. Another time I used the "point of intrest" feature to get some food and the GPS took me to a residential home address. I have also noticed that the recalculating feature lags sometimes for a few minutes (leaving you without any directions). It's almost like it decides to take a nap.I don't regret buying this model, but I would rather own something that I know I don't need to upgrade. This one does the job, but it's almost embaressing sometimes when it screws up.I have to give it a bit of credit. It does seem to hold up in the city and sometimes through tunnels. However, if you get stuck in a traffic jam in a big tunnel in the city, this unit will crap out and lose the signal. I also like how the unit estimates your arrival time. If you go the speed limit, the time estimate is pretty acurate.

review_text: I purchased this product as a travel companion on my trips to various parts of the US. It is extremely easy to use and compact enough to carry it in my briefcase.

review_title: How did I travel without it?
review_text: I love it! Some of the roadways need updated, but other than that, it was easy to use and takes all the hassle out of driving. No more watching signs or estimating times. Garmin tells you everything you need to know while you are driving. I just wish I would have bought one years ago! By the way, Amazon had the best price (even beat Wal-Mart) and the shipping was fast!

review_title: Toss Out Your Maps and Atlases
review_text: I got my StreetPilot c330 for Christmas '07 and I love it! It goes way beyond an old folded paper map or Atlas.I would sometimes have to refer to the map or Atlas for directions numerous times during a trip. It is impossible for them to tell you exactly where you are any given moment. Now, my StreetPilot c330 not only shows me where I am or where to turn, but also tells me in a plesant voice.Many times I would have to go under an overpass to get on the interstate or other roadway and be in the wrong lane because a sign is missing or blocked by large vehicles. Never again will that happen!!! My StreetPilot c330 shows me where the on-ramp or clover-leaf is and tells me which lane to get into, long before I get close to the overpass.That alone is worth purchasing the StreetPilot c330!

review_title: Best GPS
review_text: We bought the Garmin Nuvi 350 to assist us on our recent vacation to Myrtle Beach, SC. Everything about it worked great. We also had a AAA Triptik and were trying to follow those directions as well. If we changed the route that the Nuvi chose for us, it quickly recalculated. The voice prompts for street names is an excellent feature. The leather carrying case was excellent and fit nicely into my purse. A lot of research went into buying this product and I feel we got a great deal through Amazon and could not be happier with our Garmin. Our daughter lives in DC and we are looking forward to using the Nuvi in the big city. It should be a lifesaver! When I called Garmin to ask a question, the gentleman was very helpful and knowledgeable.

review_title: Very Helpful Item
review_text: I have found the Garmin c340 very reliable after testing it out for the past couple of weeks. It's not perfect and you may have to play with it sometimes to get it to do exactly what you want, but it is very easy to operate and works well. The voice prompts are clear and timely. Overall, I'm impressed with the Garmin. The one thing I didn't find that reliable was it's estimation of miles to a destination. The estimates are generally off (sometimes by quite a bit)and I haven't figured out yet if it's me or the machine. I would recommend this item.

review_text: Combined with the products offered from Kennedy Electronics, I was able to mount this on my Honda 94 Goldwing Trike and run it directly into my intercom/radio. I have a switch that allows me to flip back and forth between the radio and the Garmin so I can hear the output right on my speakers or through a headset.It does everything I wanted it to do, and I will probably be purchasing a memory card so I can download some music for trips where my local radio station doesn't reach.So far, it has been 100% accurate for all my needs and flawlessly led me to my destinations in towns I don't know at all, as well as any local places. I also use it on occasion in my car with the adaptor it came with for car use.Very easy to install the mount on the bike, I would recommend this product to anyone wanting a portable GPS for their bike or trike.

review_title: This Thing Kicks Axx
review_text: I've had this for about 2 months. Much better than I hoped. I handed it to my wife as we got in the car (she's not the best with this stuff) and said "here's the on button", "program it to take use to Jims house". After a 2 second argument she starts pushing buttons, and has it ready to go by the end of the driveway. It couldn't be easier. First question...State? You start to type New J, and buy the time you reach for the e New Jersey is on the screen. Same thing for city and street address. It's so easy to use that I never read the manual. There are many features(screens) that I didn't even know it had. Like touch the screen in the middle and you can drag the map around to look at other places (plus you can zoom in). Satilite position and strenght(not useful but cool). Find food on the road...fast food, Asian, Mex...My only complant... would be nicer with a larger screen... but that's more of a cash flow problem of mine, not the Nuvi. They're made with bigger screens. $

review_title: It's Great! when it works. . .
review_text: I have this unit and it performed so amazingly that I gave one as a gift. However after only 6 months the unit will not acquire the satellites. After resetting as instructed by the on-line support, it seemed to perk up but it didn't last very long. It is on its way back for repair under warranty. I am sadly disappointed, because it has become an invaluable travel aid not only for me, but for my direction-challenged wife. She wanted me to buy another GPS while this one is in the shop!

review_text: I very happy with the 350 I read a load of reviews and I can say they are all right - great product. It's a pity the fm traffic receiver is extra. If I could go back I would have paid extra for the 650 so I could use the fm transmitter for my car and it comes with the traffic receiver included.

review_title: 2720 Review
review_text: Why I bought the system: I bought this GPS system because it has the entire 50 states pre loaded. The ability to download real time traffic information ( traffic jams, accidents, weather ect....). The best portable system from all the research and reviews I have read. Those are the main reasons that lead me to buying the product.Experience using it: I have only had the system for about 2 weeks. I tested the system around my neighborhood and was amazed by the pin point accuracy of the GPS. The accuracy I noticed is that it showed every single street in my neighborhood without leaving anything out. The reason I was so impressed by that is because I live in a brand new development. Shocking that Garmin loaded my neighborhood into the system. The other cool thing I noticed is that the map has an option for you to view less then normal, normal, detailed, or very detailed map view. I put the option of detailed map view and it shows parks that are coming up, recreations centers, malls, stores, gas stations, ect... all the points of interest are on the map while you drive. THAT'S SWEET especially when your on the free way running out of gas.Next step I tried a point of interest. I plugged in "UPS Store" because I needed to return my Tivo system back. I quickly went easily through the menus and selected the closest UPS store to where I was located. It took me to somebody's house. There was no UPS store in the vicinity. This was my first encounter where the GPS totally misled me to an area. I got a little frustrated but no big deal its just a bad POI.Next experience my wife and I took a trip from Ohio to Pennsylvania. It was about a 6 hour drive. Anyways the GPS did an outstanding job of getting us to the destination of where we were staying. It tells you exactly how many hours, miles you have left before you arrive. If you decide to get a bite or fill up gas you will notice the arrival time increases. Of course the alternive when you speed you notice a minute here and there start to come off the arrival time. It also gauges avg miles per hour, time driving, time not driving, ect... show a lot of measurements. Another cool feature is the screen automatically goes into night mode when it gets dark. The back ground is all black and it draws red and purple lines that are easily visible at night. THAT'S COOL.The one glitch I noticed in PA was that it would tell you that you have arrived at the destination but in reality the true destination was several miles up the street. It did this for almost every location. I think this might be because we were in a rural area and not a metropolitan city. The GPS was way off. It got us to the street but we had to search for the POI or address location. We never got lost and it really did a nice job. Be ware if you live in a rural area that the unit might not be pin point accurate. Once more thing to note is the system reroutes in seconds. When you turn the unit on for the first time it take some time to load the maps and get a signal (2 minutes). After the first initial load when you load the system it gets satellite reception in a few seconds. Don't worry about load times for satellite signal.The next thing I want to test is the traffic receiver.One more thing. I recommend you buy the unit with a warranty. I bought it from BEST BUY for $999.99. The warranty was another 100 bucks. It's a 4 year guaranteed warranty. Anything goes wrong you can bring it back.PROS: Small and compact, easy to store away or hide in the vehicle-receives satellite signal quickly-pinpoint accurate-turn by turn voice prompt (sounds out the street name)-menus are easy to navigate- traffic receiver compatiable- 7 million POI's-remote control-night time vs. day light screen (automatically changes between night & day time)-Good traveling metrics (time of arrival, speed, over all trip meter)- You can download custom routes, POI's, Europe Maps, other World maps,ect...- I am sure there are many more PROS's awesome system!!!!!!!!!CONS: -pricey (you get a lot for the buck compared to in dash GPS systems)-not really pin point accurate in non metropolitan cities.I recommend this system to all bigger, intermediate, and advanced users. Good luck in your decision.

review_text: GPS for the motorcycle. You can't go wrong with the Garmin Zumo. Add the XM receiver and you have not only the GPS, but sat. radio, MP player, and use of the phone through Bluetooth.It is easy to use and definitely lives up to the waterproof claim.The only reason it did not get a 5 is because the cradle for the motorcycle is NOT waterproof and any moisture shorts out the antenna (and other) contacts. They need to supply a rain cover for when the GPS is removed from the cradle.

review_title: Great GPS for the money
review_text: After a lot of research I settled on the c530 for the price. I'm terrible with directions, and get lost a lot so this was beginning to be a necessary purchase. This GPS is great!The screen is easy to see, and the auto-adjust mode is really helpful. This GPS has an amazingly long battery life - mine has been going strong for over 5 hours. I haven't tried updating the maps, and since I bought a refurbished unit some maps were outdated, but in general I haven't had any trouble with it.I honestly can't say anything negative about the c530. For what I paid I've been extremely pleased.

review_title: Garmin from Amazon
review_text: This product is advertised as "new" in box and is definitely not. The first time I ordered the product it came in an open box with stickers off of the unit, no shrink wrap around the box, cables undone, etc. I was upset because of the price I paid for the item that was represented as brand new. I sent it back to Amazon and they assured me this would not happen again. The next unit that was delivered also was opened and not new as advertised.I have heard the product is great, I just would not recommend purchasing from amazon until they can get their advertising correct.

review_title: Motorcycle Rider/Car Driver... this is a great GPS
review_text: The 550 is as good if not better than my factory installed car GPS. Havng the buttons on the left is very handy. Though it's not recommended to use them when moving, I have found myself adjusting the volume of the MP3 player from time to time. Thus I mention that they could have made that task a bit easier, but that's a very minor detail.I do wish they made a sun shade for the 550. I did find one that "sort of works" online. But when it is in place it is a bit tough to operate those left hand buttons. Again, a minor point.The case that comes with the 550 is a very nice case, but it lacks a belt loop. So you either have to carry it in your hand, or put into a carry-all bag if you happen to have one. Now this is a pain in the butt.Now here's my biggest complaint. To use the full range of options (i.e. the XM Radio, and the Traffic / weather) you must purchase a antenna that sells for any where between $250 down to $190. That is the cheapest I've seen it online. So, you buy the 550 for the nice round number of $1,000 you still have to add the price of the antenna. Plus if you want the radio, weather and traffic you have to add the monthly charge for those services. The monthly charges I wouldn't mind so much, but I do not understand why this antenna costs more than about $35 or $40. I only think that is a rip off. But all in all, you will enjoy the 550.

review_title: Can't Beat This Unit For The Money
review_text: Took me 5 minutes to unpack and set it up in our car ( we've also used it in our truck). Pulled out of the garage and let it lock in "home" and then put in the address we were going to in another town several hours away. It guided us right to the front door with no wrong turns, no problems, easy to hear and see. Same results on the second trip in the truck to our sons new home in a community we had never been to before. This is a great little unit.

review_title: Great Until It. Broke
review_text: I was enchanted by the GPS functionality of my new Garmin Nuvi 350 when I first started using it.The ability to pinpoint my location anywhere in the USA down to the nearest intersection was a wonderful thing and I found it to be over 95 percent accurate in navigating from one location to another.The user interface is quite friendly after a short period of learning how to navigate the menus.The problems started after about a year of use when the ON/OFF switch started getting harder and harder to activate. Finally the only way I could turn the unit on or off was by plugging in the power cord. Looked up the problem on the web and found that lots of other owners had the same problems and followed the instructions for replacing the on/off switch, not a job for the casual user but it worked. I was thrilled.Then the speaker died which makes the device much less useful since it is dangerous to try to read a small screen for directions while navigating through heavy traffic. After that I started to get warnings that I should update my maps which would cost me $100.At that point I gave up and bought a Tom Tom GPS in hopes of smoother sailing.Easy John

review_title: Zumo 550 - Great for Bikes and Cars
review_text: I purchased my second Zumo 550, after my original was stolen from a rental car. The unit performs exceptionally well, and is very easy to use and understand.I use it on my BMW R1200GS and also in my car. The unit ships with all the stuff you need to mount it on the bike and in the car. There are maps available from Mad Maps which feature some nice motorcycle routes in a variety of different US states.I am a Mac user as well, and the only complaint I have so far with Garmin is that they don't seem to offer as much support for mapping software on a Mac as they do on a PC. Other than that I really think the unit is great. I give the Zumo a 5-star rating!

review_text: Extremely easy to setup and use. Just plug it in and start driving! Good interface although I wish they had a qwerty keyboard instead of the alphabetic grid that they used. Also it's very small that you can fit it in your jacket pocket so it's great for travel. For example it's ideal if you you fly somewhere and get a rental car.

review_text: The c340 was a Christmas gift for my wife and from the feedback shegives me it was the best thing I could have bought her. She is the typeof driver that gets lost easily. This gives her the confidence she neededto drive to places she would not have attempted to drive to. It was soeasy for her to use that she didn't need any instructions. I did download the manual from the Garmin website. All in all, I can say thatthis was a great investment and Amazon's price was hard to pass up.

review_title: Greatly Disappointed
review_text: When I received the Magellan Maestro 4040, the cradle was faulty and wouldn't hold the gps. I finally reached Magellan and they sent me a new one. I installed the cradle in my car, and plugged in the automobile adaptor. It immediately fell out. The contact did not fit securely in the gps. I tried to reach Magellan for three days constantly getting the message that my call could not go through. I complained to AAA, who endorses this product, and they were also unable to reach Magellan. Finally, in total frustration, I called the company from whom I had bought the extended waranty. They told me to call Amazon. Amazon was very responsive and connected me directly to Magellan who sent me a new car adaptor. I am appalled at the shoddy quality control in shipping this product and its constituent parts. Moreover, the fact that there was no way for me to contact Magellan directly demonstrates a lack of concern for the consumer by Magellan.

review_title: Does everything I want it to do
review_text: After using a Garmin GPS60 in my travels, using the ZUMO 550 was a great improvement. I read some previous reviews and was a little disappointed in some of the shortcomings of the unit. I don't know if Garmin actually addressed the shortcomings of if the reviewer just didn't know how to access the feature. Two examples; one reviewer said that you couldn't "MARK" a location. This is easily done by simply touching the vehicle icon. You can then rename the location and save it to your favorites. Another reviewer talked about the lack of a compass option unless you are in the "off road" mode. If you are not navigating, there is a letter indicator on screen constantly and by one touch, you have access to a graphic compass. You always have access to the graphic compass page while navigating with one touch.I am very satisfied with the ZUMO 550 and would recommend it. One thing I would have liked is the option of getting AM-FM radio instead of XM. I have cable TV, but I still have a problem with paying for radio.I love gadgets, and I don't consider myself a "techy", but I rate the ZUMO 550 with a "10".

review_title: Love it!
review_text: I did some research before purchasing this product, narrowed my choices down to the Garmin Nuvi or the Tom-Tom. I have had the Nuvi for several weeks now and am very impressed. It was easy to set up, came with everything I needed, easy to use, the map is very up-to-date, easy to navigate through all the screens - all in all, I'm very pleased with it. I truly thought the setup and use would be much more difficult but it was a breeze.

review_title: Awesome!
review_text: I absolutely LOVE this thing! It is one of the best investments I have ever made and highly recommend this GPS.I drive am a substitute school bus driver which means I don't often drive the same route. Originally, I was assigned to work in a city that I did not live in so I was unfamiliar with the roads. While a paper map is helpful, you can't see the street signs in the wee dark hours of the morning until you are on top of them. Even when not directing me, this Garmin is great to run on map mode because it gives you the names of the street you are approaching at least a block in advance.During the summer months while school was out I drove an Airport Limo, again, in areas I was unfamiliar with. It never failed. I got everywhere I needed to go with ease. In fact, after my first day, the dispatcher found out that I had the GPS. She said: "You did so well. I was wondering why I had not heard from you. I have drivers that have been here for years who still call me for directions. No wonder you did not call me even one." The owner heard that conversation and decided to make the GPS available for all of his drivers.The benefit of this unit over other GPS systems is that when it tells you to make a turn, it also tells you the name of the street that you are turning on to. Many GPS systems will say something like "Turn Right at two hundred feet". This is how the GPS that the owner of the limo company talks to him. He said it was difficult, because he would begin his turn only to find out it was the next turn that he needed to make, which made his driving somewhat dangerous.The only drawback that I have found with this unit is that when in San Diego the satellite info came in just a little slower than driving speed, so you often waited for it to catch up. However, in my Florida location... it works like a dream and has never let me down. I don't use the map book or google maps to get to where I need to go anymore.My Garmin Slogan is" "Don't Leave Home Without It!"

review_title: horse & bugy
review_text: Obsolete mapset. Four years ago, the intersection closest to me was change from a dogleg to straight-thru. This Garmin still tells me to go right-then-left to get across. It's a major state route. I went to my brother's for Thanksgiving and have been visiting them for 30 years, so I know the short cuts. The C530 had me get on two interstates, and avoid a construction site which had been finished 18 months ago. It fails to recognize two Walmarts closest to me, but will recognize a sporting goods store which has been closed for over a year. I tried updating on the net to no avail. Take your chances with this one. BL

review_text: I have been searching for the right GPS unit that had the feature that best suited my use. I have found it in the Garmin Street Pilot c550. The real selling point for me was the text to speech feature, the pricing and it having the Bluetooh capability. I really like the feature of being able to answer the cell phone see who is calling, and having my address book loaded into the unit. I also like the ability to load my music into it. The display looks good and is easy to read with great direction. I also like the ability of moving it between cars. I am impressed and satisfied with the unit features so far.

This review is to share with others the tremendous satisfaction we feel in knowing the crook won't be able to use the GPS because it was pin-locked. Yes, any portable GPS I buy in the future will have a pin/password-locking feature. I believe once the overwhelming majority of portable GPSs in use have this feature, the crooks will stop trying to steal them.

review_title: Good Model with tons of options
review_text: This is my second GPS (1st is Streetpilot i5) and I must say it has tons of options. I mostly upgraded to this unit because it allows avoiding specific roads, browsing of the maps at the street level, and the ability to create your own routes (both with the unit and on your PC). The bean bag mount is great as it holds the unit securely. I didn't realize until after 2 weeks that the display can be swiveled up and down as well as side to side. The up down feature is not documented.The only complaint I have is the poor power connector. It slides into the back and can be bumped very easily causing the unit to power off.Other than that everything has been great so far.

review_title: Good Product But Bad Apple
review_text: I received the product for a trip during Christmas time but 30 minutes after we started our trip the screen said low battery and I had it plugged into my cigarette lighter along with my satellite radio and it was working so I know that the power source was working, needless to say we were disappointed but upon getting back home I sent the product back and got satisfaction.

review_title: Pretty darn good.
review_text: This unit has been on my bike for two years and 16000 miles. It is bullet proof. I have dropped it, soaked it in the rain and even been in an accident with it. The unit still functions well. Only two negatives I can mention is the motorcycle mount is not completely waterproof. If rain gets down in the pins you lose XM Radio functionality until the mount drys out. A hard rain storm is enough to get the mount wet. On numerous trips I have had the mount get water in it and XM stops functioning for the rest of the trip. Second the lack of a qwerty keyboard is pretty annoying. These two minor annoyances really are minor. Overall the unit is well designed and functions extremely well for its intended purpose. I really believe Garmin had riders design this unit or they certainly got a lot of feedback from us.

review_title: Works great
review_text: It works great and has in general led me quickly to my destination and located restaurants in towns that I was passing on the interstate. One must get used to using it and I did find one location that tripped it up. I was driving along the Mississippi in New Orleans attempting to get on the bridge across to the West Bank. It directed me under the bridge and along a road parallel to it. There are multiple layers of roads on the bridge which apparently confused it for I heard the fateful word: "Recalculating". I followed the prompts and circled around a few times each time getting the dreadful "Recalculating". I finally gave up and found a sign directing me to interstate going in the opposite direction. I took it until I could exit, loop around and get on the road going in the right direction.My only wish would be for it to voice identify the road to turn on. It only says to turn right or left. The name of the road is in large letters at the top of the screen but I would prefer for the name to be included in the voice prompt.

review_title: A Good Sales Pitch but Unacceptable
review_text: The hardware doesn't work properly and I got stuck with an outdated version of the software. When recently using the unit on a trip the machine could not correctly pronounce some street names.The installed software was so outdated it took me to places that were no longer in existence. It's very apparent that Garmin is just going for the bucks and an unfortunate customer like myself will be forced to pay out the nose for an upgraded version of data that should have come with the unit.Be careful. In hopes to get the latest GPS software I waited many months before buying the unit but was still taken by Garmin. In addition to these disappointments described Garmin doesn't even provide a manual.

review_title: GARMIN ZUMO 550
review_text: This is a great GPS I bought one for myself 2 years ago and I love it. I use it in my car and on my motorcycle. Works well in both. It is easy to set up an use. Blue tooth is great with my Cardon headset. MP3 and Blue tooth cell phone come in loud and clear. I am hard of hearing so I know. Motorcycle mount was easy to in stall. The wiring was the hard part. For the car mount, I went to Walmart an bought, a GPS pad that the suction cup will work with. I set it on the console in my car. This is great , because you can move it from car to car if you have more than one. It plugs into the liter socket for power. I have not had any problems with it, in the two years that I have had it. BBest of all for you is that you can get it for a lot less tnen I paid. I paid $800.00 for mine. It is still a bit pricey, but it is well worth it. I do not think you would be sorry if you bought it. A friend of mine asked me to order this one for her. She gave it to her boy fried for Christmas. I tell all my friends how well it works. Some of them have other cheap brands and they tell me that they have problems using them.Bill Schellhas in Williamstown, N.J.

review_title: infuriating to use; impossible to have been designed by a motorcyclist
review_text: Let me preface this by saying that I have used this unit--my third, one died and was replaced and the second fell and I had to have it repaired--they sent a refurbished unit-- I have had this unit for three years and ridden with it for 45k miles. Suffice it to say I have driven it around the block. I am very tempted to give it one star.What it does do is tell you where you are. The screens are nice and as long as you are just watching the screen change with you, it is fine.But get into a situation where you must interact with this unit and forget about using it while riding.Examples:No QWERTY keyboard. Instead they have some very hard to use scroll in one screen (see Amazon image) and in another there is an ABCDEF screen. BOTH of these screens could have just as easily been QWERTY. You cannot imagine how hard it is to use while riding, and it ain't no piece of cake when stopped. It is a real pita to use.Also, the menu items are so user hostile. If you are riding and you want to find fuel these are the stepsMenu...food/lodging...fuel...all types--4 steps to find a damn gass station. Finding a motel is even worse:Menu...food/lodging...arrow down...lodging...hotel/motel--5 steps to get there. They have the "options" in alphabetic order so you have to bypass ATM and ENTERTAINMENT to get to lodging and then you have to choose MOtelAnd once you do get there-gas food motel--then you have to understand the shorthand, look to see where the arrow points. And the arrows do not just point up the road or behind you, no, they point in compass directions so they may point toward 4 oclock or 9 oclock. And that may or may not be on your route. To see if it is on your route you must highlight it, and then press show map and see if it is relevant to your ride.The menus are totally fixed and cannot be user modified. I asked on the zumoforums about this and many people chimed in to also complain about this unit's user hostility and the mod smugly answered that that's "just the way they are."I have no experience with any other GPS, but I have to believe that others have a better, much better, human interface. And it's real expensive also for these "features." I would NOT recommend this unit, and I have one that doesn't spontaneously die.I bought this unit because Garmin tells us it is desgned by bikers for bikers. That is impossible to believe. It is just marketing hype. The more I use this device the more I find fault with it and I am not mentioning how directions can be screwed up, or if you decide to change your route on the fly the unit with continue to route you back to the part of the route you intentionally skipped until you stop it (Menu...stop) and restart your route (Menu...routes...select your route...go...no).Zumo, get a clue. And the most infuriating part? I'll bet a firmware fix would change all this, but nooooooo

review_title: LIFESAVER!!
review_text: Jill is my new best friend! I can't believe I have lived this long without her. She has saved me so many times already and I've only had her a month. She is so user friendly a 7 year old could work her. She is extremely precise and accurate. Sometimes I question the route she is sending me on, but I have faith and she delivers. Just do what she says and you will be where you need to be when she says you will be there. I have NO negatives to report. She is easy to use, easy to understand, recomputes a perfect new route when you stray from her original suggestion and never misses a beat. I bought a travel case for her and I love that too. DON'T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT HER!! My husband is in outside sales and has to go from one account to another and he just punches in the next address and she gets him right there. No more maps or asking directions. And she is very accurate when it comes to what time you will arrive. We are never late anymore either because of Jill. I am considering buying another since my hubby hogs this one and I feel lost without her.

review_title: The best for the money . . .never get lost . . .
review_text: I have known people who owned this, and when I was relocated to another town far away from my familiar surroundings, the first thing that came to mind was to buy this. I never get lost and if I do make a wrong turn (because I'm not following what it's telling me to do), it will redirect me. Amazon had the lowest price for this item that I found when I was researching where to buy it, and now I have advertised it to others who want to buy it. I feel a new level of confidence when I go to a new town or big city, and since I can always find my way around, it takes less time to find things than getting lost and driving for a while to look for certain destinations. I definitely would recommend this to anyone who was looking for a small and convenient GPS system.

review_title: Good value for the money
review_text: Garmin n&uuml;vi 350 3.5-Inch Portable GPS NavigatorThis is a great little unit!! I did not need a GPS with all the bells and whistles just a GPS that does turn by turn directions this model delivers just that. Setup was simple and right out the box this GPS is a winner. To my plesant surprise it even came preloaded with 2009 maps. So far after a months use my only complaint is ... Why didn't I buy a unit like this sooner? It beats Verizons VZ Navigator service that I was paying for every month.

review_title: I like it. But POIs?
review_text: I've had 4 other GPS, including a very early military model in the Navy. This is by far the best I've used. Really loved being able to throw out all the maps in the car.On the negative side - Magellan went cheap on the map data. There are very good map databases out there, complete and frequently updated. This is not one of them. It tries to route me through streets that were dead-ended years ago.But my real issue is with the Points of Interest. Businesses come and go over the years. Magellan doesn't seem to really care. And the custom POIs that are supposedly available online? Traffic cameras, school zones etc are very well mapped IN EUROPE. I've found no downloadable data sets for the US besides zip codes.Routing is quirky. It rarely sends me out and back on the same streets. It always tries to get me onto a major highway as soon as possible. This results in me going to a destination on one highway, then on minor streets. On the return trip it puts me on a different highway, then on minor streets. Neither of which were the fastest route. Minor streets straight through would have been much quicker.The ability to create detours is very strange. You select a rectangular area encompassing multiple roads, rather than picking sections of a road.

review_title: A must for the serious Rider
review_text: Pros: easy to use even with my cold weather gloves on!Cons: I don't have enough vacation time to ride my bike on more trips"I received my Zumo 550 in the mail on the day I was leaving for a five day motorcycle trip. I did not have time to read the instructions, only time to mount it and go! The unit was so simple to use I was an expert by the end of the day. I traveled 1900 total miles on this trip and the Zumo 550 became an invaluable tool! I used it in the mountains of North Carolina always expecting the unit to Not know where I was or loose satilites but that Never happened. The built in blooth tooth linked my cell phone and bluetooth headset and I was able to hear directions clearly! With the extra mount for my car, I am able to quickly move the unit from bike to car effortlessly. I look forward to adding the XM antenna to an already feature packed unit. I loaded my 2GB SD card and listened to my favorite music and also loaded pictures of the trip on the unit as well. Don't bother looking at any other units for your motorcycle, THIS IS IT!!"As for you folks upset about having to use a headset to hear the directions, how were you expecting to hear anything from a speaker on a GPS at highway speeds? Why would you not want the blue tooth headset to link your phone and listen to mp3 music as well? Anyway, everyone has an opinion.

review_title: Intuitive and simple to use
review_text: The setup and user interface on this StreetPilot is so straightforward that it really needs no instruction manual. I love it. So far, it has found all the locations I've entered and gives good voice prompts. It quickly recalculates a route if I miss a turn and gets me back on track. My only complaint is that it is a bit tricky to get in and out of the mounting bracket used to secure it to the dashboard or windsheild. It's easier to enter an address while holding it in my hands, instead of leaning over to reach it while mounted to the windshield.

review_title: Great product
review_text: Did alot of research and I decided to get the Garmin Streetpilot C340. The reviews that I had read on Amazon is what lead me to this product. The reviews were accurate. We are very please with our Garmin. We used it on a recent trip to California. When we got our rental car we plugged it in and it took a little while to find where we were but lead us to our destination. We feel very confident now when we are traveling. It gave us enough time to adjust lanes to make sure we made the right exits. It also told us our estimated arrival time. Wish had purchased this alot sooner!

review_title: StreetPilot 2720
review_text: I purchased the Garmin StreetPilot2720 for myself a few months back, and I've had nothing but fun with it every since... We have taken two small trips with it already without plans, finding restaurants and hotels with the unit. If I were to make any improvements at all, it would have a battery and it would also have the ability to do long distance searches for points of interest, etc. These two items alone should not be enough to deter you from purchasing it.... I have done a lot of research and read numerous reviews on other units, and I wouldn't trade for any other unit in this price range. A "big" plus for this unit is the size of the screen. It is large enough to sit on the dash with clear instructions, even without the voice option turned on.Since I purchased mine, I decided to treat my dad to one as well... Needless to say he's been like a kid in a candy store ever since!I give this unit 4 out of 5 stars... It's a keeper!!!

review_title: The Garmin C530 Is State of The Art Gps
review_text: This GPS Garmin C530 (along with The Garmin Nuvi 350 for $130 more) is "state of the art". It is so because it has a "Sirf Receiver" that is more sensitive in acquiring satellites than "normal" receivers. The reveiws on this web site are incorrect about the maps---this one has the latest version 8 maps available. This one is better than the Garmin 340, 330 and 320 because it is brighter and, once again, it has The Sirf receiver. And, it costs about the same as the C340 which makes it a good deal! Is it worth the extra money as compared with the 320 and 330. Yes, because if your GPS won't "acquire a satellite" it is worthless. Email: boland7214@aol. I highly recommend this GPS.ONE MORE THING: I don't want people to get angry with me for not telling them that this C530 does NOT have "voice recognition of streets". That's where the voice SAYS the name of the street. I found out after trying units with and without "voice recognition" that you DO NOT NEED IT. The reason? The reason is that the name of the upcoming street is WRITTEN IN BIG LETTERS on top of the screen. You WILL need to glance at the GPS when making turns so when you do, if you know how to read, you WILL read the name of the street for yourself. Thus, there is no need for "Garmina" (the voice) to READ the name of the street for you...that is unless you're illiterate and failed kindergarten! :o)PS: My C530 died on me about 10 days ago. But, Garmin sent me a brand new one with no hassle on warranty. Write me and I'll let you know how the new one is doing.Also, I tried the Magellan 2000 and the Garmin C530 side by side today. I liked the Garmin screen "look" better and it is easier to read than the Magellan. But, they are both good GPS Navigators---but I still prefer the Garmin C530. The Magellan 2000 cannot handle any European or other maps than North America while the Garmin C530 already has maps available, for a price, for Europe. If you are going to Europe do not buy the Magellan 2000---you'd need either the Garmin C530 or the Magellan 2200T or above.ADDENDUM AS OF MAY 20, 2008: I saw a Garmin C550 for sale for about $200. Due the low price for these, I'd go for the C550 now. The most notable inprovement of the C550 over the C530 is the "text to voice" feature that SAYS the name of the street instead of only putting it up in large letters on the screen. Though this feature isn't a large benefit, it is probably worth $50 more to get it.

review_title: Bang for the buck
review_text: It is the best GPS unit you can get for only $170 which I bought it in Amazon, and the price keeps falling. I have an pretty old factory-built GPS in my BMW car. I don't use it anymore.The Nuvi 350 simply calculates the route much faster and more intelligent when you miss a turn or exit that it finds a new route rather than insisting you on the old one.I have a friend that just bought a new Mercedes ML350 and I don't think the built-in GPS is better than this portable unit. The user-interface of Mercedes unit is horrible and the graphics output is very plain.The only drawback when compared to factory-built car GPS is that the portable unit doesn't work well in tunnel as it relies on satellite signal where built-in ones use other sensor in the car as well.In my opinion, if you don't really need other features like bluetooth, wider screen, and other features I consider gimmicks, Nuvi 350 is perfect for such this price, as it is solid for one thing, navigation.

review_text: I was pretty happy when i first made the purchase, reading prior reviews with the features the 720 had. After receiving the item, i immediatley powered it to my cell phone. I wanted to use the plus services for traffic,i work evenings and encounter alot of roadwork which local news radio stations fail to give.i noticed the bluetooth feature captured my 720 for handsfree,but the other features failed. the tomtom website clearly states the razr v3 is compatible,it definitly isnt, as mine reached 65% and gave me an error message,download failed.i called tomtom and was immediately given the run around,transfered to the technical dept,who then in turn transfered me to their mobile unit who never came on the phone.i emailed them directly, and received a reply that razr phones ARENT COMPATIBLE FOR PLUS SERVICES.i felt totally mislead, BEWARE IF YOU PLAN ON USING THE PLUS SERVICES WITH YOUR CELL..granted there is an optional fm/traffic antenna which will run u back $129 or more,depending when you read this.

review_title: Maps are so old i tmakes the unit useless
review_text: I boughtmy C330 at Walmart for $[...] plus tax. The maps are so old on the unit you really have to pay for an update that cost $70.00. I think this is an absolute ripoff. Garmin should not do this - that is sell old product that has to have an update just to be useful. I have contacted Garmin to see what they will do but I have not heard from them yet. I would be very careful buying this product if it is on sale - Make sure the latest updated maps are on the system. Otherwise it is pretty easy to use. I like the preloaded information that helps you look for resturants and other attractions. Very useful but also very much out of date. The versionof Maps on my unit is at least 2 years old. This shoudlbe a crime really. I have tried to return to Walmart and they would not take it back. Feel like I wasted the money. If I can't resolve with Garmin, it will be a long, long time before I buy another Garmin product.

review_title: It works very well
review_text: We've only had this for a few weeks but it works predictably and well. We were receiving a weak but usable satelite signal even inside our house. My 10 year old daughter had it operational and pretty much figured out how to program it on the way home from the store. The convenience it provides makes it worth the investment. The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is for it's size. It has a battery but it's just large to the point that it is a little cumbersome to use it outside the car. The Nuvi was considered and given the oportunity I would have spent the extra $$ for the 350 or 360. If you're considering a gps, this one is great.

review_title: Don't waste your money!
review_text: The Magellan Maestro 4040 is the third Magellan GPS unit I've purchased. The unit is compact and easy to use. However the database it uses is terrible. Routes given by the 4040 are often 10% longer in time and distance than popular Internet mapping programs. Accuracy is poor also; usually a block difference between the 4040 and the real address. My suggestion is to look at other brands or use Internet mapping.

review_title: Great when you don't know your way.
review_text: I originally rated this 3 stars but I've grown to like the GPS more. If I could change the star rating, I would bump it up to 4. My original gripe was that if you know the area well you'll often find it calculates awful routes.However, when you know the area well there is no reason to use the GPS. I was using it around home to play with it.When I use it in places I am not familiar with I love it. Sure, it may be calculating an awful route, but I am blissfully ignorant. It always gets you there.Specific things I like about this model: small size is great, easy to put in your pocket or your bag when you leave the car. screen is bright in day. voice is clear. ease of use. found signal in the city most of the time.

review_text: This is by far the best bang for the buck I have spent in a very long time. It is an indispensable tool for those on the move and needing to get from point A to B and all points and destinations in between. There are a number of GPS options out there, but after careful research and reviews from many different sources Garmin was constantly and consistently on or right near the top in most categories. Garmin provides a number of different units and for me this little guy provided the most features that I will use at a very reasonable price point. It is easy-to-use and works just great. No more reading maps, printing MapQuests, or asking directions at gas stations. It shows you and it tells you. How easy is that? Get a GPS and get a Garmin!

review_title: Research pays off !
review_text: I throughly researched GPS's before I bought this one. I have had it almost a year now and there is no doubt that I made the right call on this one.- It is by far the easiest to use - practically intuitive.- It is so small it fits in a pocket or purse which is great if you valet park or park in high theft areas.- Also great if you are visiting a city because you can carry it with you and use it to locate restaraunt, theaters, landmarks, ect.- Voice directions are very helpful so you can watch road and not have to look at GPS.- It is not confused by jughandle turns, access roads or service roads like many GPS's are.On the downside:- No bluetooth phone.(available on newer Nuvi models)- Offers only one route at a time (shortest, fastest, ect.) others offer three routes at once and you choose.

review_text: This is agreat GPS!! It does every thing I wanted it to do for me. We just returned from a 2000 mile trip and we used it several times to find POI's like hotels, service stations, eating places. We have changed the data fields with more info than out of the box. It only thing that would make it better would be a little larger screen.

review_text: Pros:Picks up the satellite signal very fast. Even works indoors.If you pass your route , the NUVI recalculates very fast. I would say within a few seconds.Cons:Doesn't come with any software program to enter personal address. You have to enter them by hand and if you reset the unit everything is lost. I wish the NUVI came with some sort of alternative mounting fixture for CA residents. I had to go buy a generic air vent attachment at best buy and zip tie it together.

review_title: Better than built in
review_text: Best human interface of any electronic device I've ever owned or seen. Far superior to the built-in unit in my fancy Mercedes. The "heads-up" style display (perspective view) is easy to read at a glance. It is bright and clear under all conditions except when sun is shining directly on it... note however that wearing polarized sunglasses diminishes the brightness significantly. The touch screen menu is clear, simple, and user friendly. It takes you to exact street numbers, not to a range. It shows you names of cross streets as you approach. Window mount is well designed and secure. You can buy an extra window mount for ease in cross-decking the unit between vehicles. It knows which streets are one-way. It knows the restricted hours for our HOV commuter lanes in Washington DC area. It is not perfect, however. It occasionally picks a less-than-optimal route (but you still get there, and it recalculates when you know better and ignore an instruction). By all means plot a route with MapQuest also if you are planning a trip before you get into the car and go... no way a little hand-size unit like this will be as intelligent and up-to-date as MapQuest with its massive servers. The Nuvi's built in rechargeable lithium-ion battery is not user replaceable when it eventually dies. Before you can use the map that comes with the unit you have to establish an on-line account to activate it. Nuvi provides regular software updates for functions... not sure how often the maps are updated. Overall there are very few drawbacks. A great product.

review_title: Love the unit, not sure I like Garmin
review_text: I'm not really sure how to rate this. I love the unit itself. The interface is very clean, very easy to use, and very responsive. You can learn how to do all the basic stuff in about 5 minutes. The problem I have is that twice now, the unit has sent me to a store that no longer exists. I checked the automatic updating program, and it said that there aren't any new maps available. I then checked the website, and there was a much newer version of the map available for $69. I emailed Garmin, and assumed that they'd send me the current version for free since I just bought this brand new unit. Nope. They gave me a completely convoluted and self serving reason for why they don't feel I deserve the current set of maps on a brand new device. Very strange. Eventually they agreed to sell it to me for half price. I'm still not sure if I'm going to do it.

review_title: Garmin Nuvi 350
review_text: I had this product for over a month now and absolutely love this product. The software is easy to use and very little skill is needed in operating this product. Navigation wise, this product is very easy to see and hear, directions seem accurate and percise. The Nuvi 350 is good product if your a first time buyer. I never thought it would come in handy so much in my daily life. The 350 offers so many options if you like music, or need to find out what is the closest store from you exact location, too viewing the whole United States and pin pointing the exact spot or location you need to go. It is a very handy tool if you know the just the name of a place or location and it will search its database and find the location with a phone number and address. I would recommend this product to anyone that is a little skeptical or just doesnt know what the right brand is to buy. I hope this product gives you the same quality and reliability it has given me.

But I can't figure out how to input intersections (often you don't have an exact address) which is a big problem. Screen is very sensitive and sometimes I accidentally disrupt the instructions while driving.

review_title: Can't go anywhere without it!
review_text: I recieved the Garmin Nuvi as a Christmas present and so have been driving with it for about 6 months. I am basing this review off my experience with the Tomtom ONE, which my father owns. I found that the Garmin was so simple to use and made my life easy, especially when I wanted to find stores and didn't have internet access or any way to look up the nearest location of a store. With the Garmin was able to just spell the name and do a quick search; once I chose the store location, it navigated me right to the store- no problem. While the Tomtom ONE has a similar feature with the POI, I found it more difficult to search. The other thing I liked about the Garmin was the detour feature. I drive around DC and Long Island alot, due to my job and often, as one could imagine, I find myself stuck in bumper to bumper traffic. One simple step, and I was detoured off of the highway (or whatever road I may be on) and re-routed. Again, while this can be done on the Tomtom, I found if more difficult since there are added steps and screens one has to go through. After using my Garmin, my father has decided to trade-in his Tomtom for a Garmin of his own!I now find myself automatically turning my Garmin on whenenver I am in the car- even if I know where I am going. The design itself is extremely compact and holds alot of extra features, such as an MP3 Player and an audiobooks feature. Though it is a little pricey, I highly recommend this product (especially if you are new to the world of gps') to anyone

review_title: Good little device with some drawbacks
review_text: There are two types of trip on which a GPS is useful. One is finding an address you don't know in your own city: is this case it's best for the last mile, delivering you right to the address you need. The chances are that around your own home or office you'll have a favorite route which is different to what the Garmin chooses, so you just have to ignore it and let it recalculate, which it happily does. The second type of trip is a driving vacation. Here this machine is at its best and worst. What's good: it will take you from wherever you are to your destination address in the next town or city on your itinerary, however many miles away. It will do so with spoken words, including the names of streets you are about to turn into. It will also take you to major attractions without you necessarily knowing their address. En route, you have a choice of views. I find that in town, where there are lots of turns, you want the classic 3D view, where the car (or arrow, you can change the symbol) is in the foreground and the streets come towards you. Cleverly, if you're sitting on a wide view, the machine will cut to a close-up view automatically as a turn approaches. On the open road, however, the 3D view is pretty meaningless and you want to switch to the North up view and touch the minus (-) sign a few times. With the North up view it's like looking at a traditional map: if you're driving south-east, for example, the arrow or car symbol will be pointing to the bottom right. By zooming out, you give yourself perspective: you can see towns and attractions situated a few miles in any direction. What's bad: it takes an endless amount of touches to change the view from 3D to North up and back: definitely not safe unless you stop the car. Also, and this is serious, for smaller towns, either they don't bother gathering local information about one-way streets and other restrictions, or the information they have is out of date. Case in point, Natchez, Mississippi, a town where all major streets are one way, alternately going in one direction or the other. The Garmin tried, tried and tried again to send us down one way streets in the wrong direction. When we (fortunately) noticed and ignored it, it then recalculated to take us round the block and back on to the same one way street in the wrong direction. Eventually we gave up on it and found our own way out of town, thus negating the whole point of having a GPS. There are other, less serious niggles: for example, if you just want to visit the downtown of a city, there seems no way to tell it that other than making up a fictional address: we found that most towns have a 100 Jefferson St or Washington St. Anyway, once you get used to it, the device is fun and most of the time useful. It's very small size means you can not only easily travel with it, you can also remove it and take it in your pocket when you park your car. If you hate trailing wires, the Garmin has several hours of battery life and can be recharged with any mini-USB charger, probably the same as your cellphone uses. All in all I was glad to have it on vacation, but they really need to sort out the local information problem and build in the ability to create shortcuts to favorite views.

review_title: Not Bad But it won't play Iron Maiden
review_text: The concept is great and is all right for listening to talk. But needs improvement in the bass. I tried a cut from an iron maiden album and the distorton was terrible. Garmin might do well to get with Bose and figure out how to make a good small speaker. Also there should be a way to delete the cuts without using an additional computer. If there is, I did not find it.Also, the information on it is out of date. I still wish there was a way to download monthly updates to the data in regards to food, shopping, enertainment, etc. I think that could be a good service and additional source for revenue for Garmin

review_text: I did a lot of research prior to purchasing this item and heard nothing but great reviews therefore, I bought it as a Christmas present for my husband. He travels for work and needed this to help him to get to various places. He loves it. It is wonderful because it gets him from point A to point B everytime without any problems. If you are looking for a basic model and do not want all the bells and whistles - I would highly suggest this Garmin GPS model(c330) before you can no longer get it! It goes fast. I got a great deal on Amazon and got free shipping included. Again, this is a steal!!!!!!

review_title: Garmin Nuvi 350
review_text: Hello,One of the reasons that I purchased the Garmin Nuvi 350 was for the simplicity of use since my wife tends not to be electronically inclined. After the first trip her comment was I wouldn't have made it to my meeting on time without it. She had encountered heavy fog which obstructed her view of the street signs and could barely see the vehicle in front of her. The Garmin worked flawlessly guiding her to the destination when she couldn't see by giving her advance notice of upcoming turns. After the second trip her comment was I love it...She traveled to area where previously she had experienced problems in reaching her destination and returning home without getting lost or turned around...I would highly recommend this unit for anyone. I like the size of the unit and the window bracket since it travels much easier than the TomTom 700 that I previously purchased. Also I think this unit is more accurate that my old one and she can use it which is a huge plus...David

review_title: BEWARE OF MAGELLAN!!!
review_text: These products look nice and seem to have a lot of features and they make you all kinds of promises about how accurate they are and how the maps are updated every two years. Don't believe a word of it. These things are junk and Magellan will leave you high and dry. The routing is a joke. I've wasted so much time following these directions only to find out there was a much easier, quicker way. It's taken me in a complete circle for no apparent reason. That, of course, is when the machine actually functions. I've been in the middle of a route and the thing just freezes up and, after you finally notice it's frozen and you're probably way off route, you have to completely reset/reboot the machine.I had the traffic service for a while too. Again, what a joke. We had a major freeway completely shut down and under construction for over two years and this thing tried to route me to that expressway every time I went somewhere. I called Magellan who told me to call Navteq who finally updated their software AFTER the freeway was reopened. What a waste of money.Oh, and if you expect any kind of customer service, forget it. Magellan will very politely tell you you're screwed. Map updates every two years? Sure, if you buy a new machine because the one you own has been discontinued, along with whatever mapping software contract that supported it. That's happened to me twice so far. Oh, but if you trade your $300.00+ machine in, they'll give you $50.00 towards a new $300.00 machine and then try to sell your traded-in machine for $150.00 to some other sap.Don't waste your money or time on any magellan product. Magellan isn't even in the top 35 in the latest Consumer Reports ratings. Garmin dominates followed by Tom Tom. There's a reason they're slightly more expensive than magellan. You may save a few dollars on a magellan GPS but what good is a GPS that can't navigate and has outdated maps and freezes up all the time? I have to think a lot of these positive reviews are from people who have never owned a GPS before and are too distracted by all the flashy superfluous features to realize how bad the core functions are. Have you seen that Allstate Insurance commercial in which Dean Winters pretends to be a GPS and causes the driver to make a wrong turn and crash? That's most likely a Magellan GPS he's pretending to be.Bottom line: Listen to the bad reviews. Listen to the warnings. Listen to Consumer Reports. DON'T BUY MAGELLAN!!!

review_text: I first got the garmin i-5 cuz it was cheaper and i wanted a small gps. big mistake. it was worthless in nyc, and worked not so well in DC (where i live). by worthless i mean, constantly losing signal, etc.i've used the nuvi in dc and philly, in the car and on feet. works fine. also, the navigator has a scrolling map, meaning you search different parts of the map not on the screen. and it labels just about EVERYTHING. I was driving by and noticed a small lake on my right. i clicked on it on the nuvi and it told me the name of the lake. nifty.

review_title: Garmin Streetpilot refurbished
review_text: The Garmin Streetpilot c550 refurbished that I received from the factory was as described and has great functions. Unfortunately, the unit was not working properly (would not connect through car adapter). I ordered another car adaptor thinking it was just the adaptor (paid an additional $24.00) and found it was the unit instead. So, the unit needed to be returned. I would expect that something that comes from the factory as refurbished would have been inspected. Now I am without the unit for a few weeks and incurred additional expenses.

review_title: Does exactly what it claims to do - not much more
review_text: I like the product, and it is really useful.However, I would like to see some things improved:1. Initial connection to satellites is too long 2. The machine needs to be rebooted from time to time, when it gets stuck looking infinitely for satellites 3. Is it a little large, looking like a CRT television - making it hard to stow or carry around, I thing a thiner design could be better.

review_title: Uses old maps
review_text: My subdivision is 4 years old and appears on Google Maps, Mapquest, and Yahoo...but not on this Garmin Nuvi 350. It cannot find my house, the subdivision, or the tollway to it (which has been open for about 2 years). I have connected the unit to the Garmin web for the latest update...none available. If you travel or live anywhere that has undergone change or addition in the last 4 to 5 years be advised that Garmin probably will not be able to get you there. On old established roadways it seems to do a great job. Hate to turn in a negative review amongst all of these positives, but 400.00 for a GPS that cannot find your own house is unacceptable.

review_text: The Garmin StreetPilot c330 is a terrific GPS. I had rented an Avis Where2 unit made by Garmin when an unforseen airline problem forced me to spend a weekend in Detroit with no maps.I learned enough about the software in 2 minutes to make travel to a hotel at midnight a cinch using the Avis unit.Upon returning home, I bought the c330 through Amazon.The c330 is not pocket sized, but it is a great value with an easily readable display, simple controls, very intuitive software, good battery life, and feature rich for the price. It's a winner!Garmin StreetPilot c330 Vehicle GPS Navigator

review_title: Ease Of Use
review_text: I seldom make reviews unless an item perform exceptionally well or really bad. I purchased this unit for my wifes birthday based on the many reviews I read. I sought after affordability, ease of use, and performance. This unit fits the bill perfectly.My wife is a "team mom", and she frequently drives to various gyms for games all over town. She also had a bad habit of driving with the phone to her ear (she refuses to wear an earpiece). Now she can receive calls hands free, and the screen clearly displays the incming caller ID. I had limited experience with GPS systems, so I was a bit nervous about what top expect. After our 1st use, I know I made a good choice. Afer "playing" with it for 10 minutes, the wifey handles her navigation like a pro. With a touch of the "Where To" menu she enters the address (if known) or she searches for it by name similar to a google search.Its interface is simple and intuitave - we've yet to read the directions. The display is bright and clear under all lighting situations we've encountered; your next move is displayed clearly on the screen; and the spoken directions are given at about the right time as a reminder. There are several voice options, (my wife prefers the Brit guy voice, I prefer the Aussie babe accent :-)As far as the navigation goes, I've observed that it "links up" in 3 seconds or less, and if you chose to stray off course, it recalculates within a second or 2.I'm sure there are many more features, but we were looking for the ability to get simple directions clearly displayed and spoken. Really, I'm amazed at how often she uses it and how we got by this long without it.Overall, you will have a hard time beating this model for something that works well.

review_title: Garmin StreetPilot c330 Excellent Buy
review_text: I'm a novice with GPS technology and did lot of research before purchasing my Garmin StreetPilot c330. One of the leading consumer magazines liked the Garmin c330 and that affected my choice. I couldn't be more pleased. I needed to download latest maps but had no problem doing that. I also purchased the dashboard mount so it's easier to see while driving. Thought I might miss having street names on voice but that's not a problem at all - certainly not worth spending extra money for it.

review_title: Great unit, easy to set up and use
review_text: I pulled my Tom Tom out of the box, charged it for the required 2 hours and then started playing with it around the house. It proved super easy to program and I liked that I could see the instructions to my destination in text as well as the normal map view. Then I used it to get to a destination 45 minutes away that I was pretty sure I knew how to get to, but just wanted to be sure and it worked beautifully.Like any good GPS it re-mapped my route as I detoured to get gas, and the voice instructions were really excellent providing plenty of time to change lanes on the high way for upcoming exits. I liked the large screen display, which is easy to follow (although I generally ignored it as the voice instructions were so good). It asked for when I needed to get to my appointment and navigated me the most direct route (given current gas prices this is critical).Why not 5 stars? I wish it had a plug in for when I'm home (comes with computer USB plug in and car charger), but I'm guessing I can buy one if I get really annoyed. Also, I wish the volume was louder, I had to keep the radio nearly off to hear the voice. I do recommend purchasing a separate mounting pad (like a non-skid bean bag) to ensure you don't have the tell-tale suction cup mark on your windshield, a sign to potential thieves to break into your car to look for your GPS unit.

review_title: Almost perfect
review_text: In short, this is a great product and highly recommended. Free upgrades are easily installed. I've used it for over a year now and have found it almost unreal in its ability to deliver the goods. Since it is portable, I use it in rental cars when out of town. Really great for getting out of and back to often confusing big airport rental car lots. Only two minor complaints:--the screen is a bit washed out in bright sun. Not sure how to fix that but hopefully there is a solution to be found in future models.In cloudy weather or at night it is fine.--more important, the voice turn indicator comes much too late. Sometimes it is fine, e.g., "Turn left on Main Street in 400 feet." More often, however, it will give you this instruction only when you are just crossing the street you should actually have turned on. When the screen is washed out from the sunlight, you need this voice instruction in advance! This is particularly annoying when you are on a three or four lane road and you know from the lower right corner screen instructions that you will be turning in, say, 400 feet, but you don't know whether to the right or the left.

review_title: Poor routing but otherwise ok
review_text: Got this on Black Friday 2007 after having used Tom Tom and would have to advise against buying this. You need to download the Firmware update to get many of the earlier bugs fixed but make sure you do not attach to your PC before starting the update or you may have USB Hardware issues. Firmware update does allow you to see expected arrival time (by tapping on distance to go).My biggest hate though is the routing. I wanted to go from Alpharetta, GA to Panama City, FL. I've done this journey numerous times and it should take 5 1/4 hrs and about 320 miles. When I ask the unit to calculate the Fastest Route it takes me on a 500+ mile trip on I75/I10 and it says it will take 8+ hours. When I ask for the Shortest Distance, it more or less takes me the way I want to go (says the 320 mile I expected) but says it will take around 6 hours.....so how comes it won't pick this for the Fastest route. (For comparison Mapquest calculates my preferred route at 319.75 miles and 5 3/4 hrs). I found a similar issue with some local routes also....very odd and very annoying.I saw other comments about maps out of date. Mine just says version 27 (with no date) and the Magellan website says they expect to issue updates every 12 - 18 months although does not state what, if anything, they will cost (the firmware update is free btw)Its not a bad unit but I just know the Tom Tom is better and about the same price

review_title: Great product at an affordable price!
review_text: ProsThis product works great. I am new to the Houston, Texas area so I bought this to help me get around this huge city. It works great. It is easy to set up and use. It has lots of features, many that I haven't had the time to try yet, such as a built in mp3 player and fm transmitter so you can hear directions from your car's stereo system. The really nice thing I like about this product is if you know a short-cut to where you are going, the device automatically recalculates the route, instead of constantly demanding you to turn around. In every case, it picked up on my short-cut! The map updates are free as well, and the unit will notify you automatically when there is a new version available.ConsI selected the free shipping and it took almost three weeks to arrive. I was hoping to have the device for a trip to Dallas, but it took so long to arrive, I had to take my trip without it. If you order this product, go ahead and pay for shipping if you want it in less than three weeks. The estimate on the website said 9 business days, but this wasn't the case with my order. It took much longer to arrive.

review_title: EASIEST GPS
review_text: This is a great basic GPS unit. I had the Garmin c330 but the c340 reads the street names to turn on to. Many car rentals use this unit to rent for $10 a day in their rentals. It is the best unit because it is dumby proof. Without ever having used a GPS unit, anyone can be figure out how to use this without a manual in just a few minutes. If you miss a turn the c340 will re-route your course faster than any other companies GPS. I use this unit every day in my work. I have a new found confidence knowing that I will never be lost where ever I drive.

review_title: Great GPS System!
review_text: This is an awesome GPS system. I have had two previous GPS systems built in the dash, and this one is definitely superior, not to mention easier to use. Screen and voices are very clear. It announces street names as well as names entered into my favorite locations. As you approach an intersection, it even tells you what the next signal is so no guessing what street is coming up. Very compact, easy to walk or drive with! Truly a great system for new or experienced users.

review_title: Great GPS--no more map quest.
review_text: After much deliberation I went with the Garmin as it had the best reviews of all the systems. I think the NUVI is worth the premium over the Street Pilot series as it is a much nicer and compact package. We are able to travel with it on the plane and walk on the streets without any difficulty. They all come with the Text-To-Speech which keeps me less dependant on viewing the screen. The screen size is more than adequet and the reciever is sensitive enough that we can keep it by the gear shift and it will still catch the satellite signal--something I have heard the tom-toms are not able to do. Suprisingly, my Garmin 350 is able to locate new bypasses that just opened after its manufacture date. The battery life is approx 7 hours by my estimate. My only major complaint is the quality of the voice can be better. Overall, the MUVI is high recommend..as it is very portable and now all our cars and family members can share it the security of a GPS device.

review_title: TomTom support is not worth the price
review_text: I am on my second TomTom product and have been moderately satisfied with the products. I have always had trouble acquiring a signal and it often takes two to three minutes to acquire a signal. That alone makes it impossible to navigate out of an unfamiliar airport. But once the unit catches on it works fairly well.I am most recently disappointed with TomTom support. I purchased an updated North America map and have had great difficulty downloading it. Also, I purchased the map at full price and it was discounted within a week. Because TomTom considers a download attempt, "breaking the seal", they will not honor the discounted price.I will not purchase another TomTom nor will I recommend TomTom to anyone I know who is in the market for a GPS machine.If you do purchase a TomTom, ALWAYS read the agreements, word-for-word and do not pay full price for anything.

review_title: Garmin Nuvi 350 Almost There
review_text: The Nuvi 350 is easy to use and provides an amazing variety of tools. It's readable even in bright sunlight. It is very useful while navigating to a specific destination. But, it lacks the capability of inserting multiple "viapoints" while determining a route, and, therefore, it is a poor trip planning tool. I plan trips using a PC-based tool and use the outcome to help me define a "Favorites" list for input to the Nuvi.A last item: One can enter coordinates (latitude/longituude), store/name them, go to them, and ask for the current location's coordinates, but one cannot ask for the coordinates of a named item on the Favorites List, Nuvi's map, or within the stored locations that come with the Nuvi.

review_text: The Garmin is just fine. My only negative critiscism is that the Amazon description of this product was not very complete. It did not describe what was in the box. I thought I had to order a separate cable, but all the various cables were in the box. Great deal! But then I had to return the extra cables I bought, and pay for shipping which was subtracted from my refund. Please Amazon; your products and prices are great, but try to do a little better on your descriptions of what is included in each item. Thanks for the opportunity to comment.

I did have to contact Garmin Support and have them "unlock" the serial number so that I could register my unit for firmware downloads. They did just that, promptly. No problems. Fast shipping and was what I expected from the unit. I would order from them again.

review_title: Pros and Cons of Mio C220
review_text: I took this GPS with me on separate trips to Baltimore, Boston, PA/Delaware. My sister has taken it to North Carolina. Overall, this is a very good GPS with such a low price tag.Pros:1. Fairly accurate directions for road trips (of course, if you use it in your hometown, it wouldn't be accurate since you know all the shortcuts)2. Small size, portable. In many cities where homeless and questionable people roam, it is very convenient to just shove the gps unit in the glove box. The screen is enough for looking at maps and directions.3. Easy to program, customize. If you browse around, you will find websites that shows you how to change the skins, add a media player, and change wallpaper. Or, you can just use it as a gps too.4. Voice prompt. It doesn't have text to speech, but it gives advance warning on how far you are to the next turn. Some people complain about the low volume, I have no problem with the volume. I also do not blast music.5. POI works very well. I used the POI feature extensively on my PA trip. I used it to locate bookstores, movie theaters, and hotel. I even used it to locate bestbuy in Delaware so I can purchase my laptop tax free. The POI locations were very useful and come in handy.6. Price. At $179.99, it's very affordable.Cons:1. Screen Freeze. I have not encountered this problem on all of my trips. But according to my sister, it froze on her while she was in North Carolina. She did a simply hard reset, and the unit was back on. I think the problem is probably she drop the unit a few time while she was driving.2. NOT for traveling in big cities. The gps gets confused when roads are close together. Satellite signals are easily lost in NYC due to high-rise buildings blocking signals.Overall, I like this gps very much. It was a great buy. I travel alot now that I don't have to constantly trying to figure out where I'm going.

review_title: Outstanding product.
review_text: Yes, it's true! This is a fantastic device. Just a couple of notes:1) The 350 I purchased in October 2006 came with the latest maps (v8). My understanding is that earlier this year the 350s came with v7 installed.2) The device can show the latitude, longitude and elevation (it's in the satelite view).3) The mp3 player sounds very good. I hooked it to my car's Bose system by using a plain old tape adapter and I'm very satisfied with it.4) The suction cup is perfectly glued to the windshield! It was pretty hard to remove it upon returning my rented car. I've no idea why some people complain about it - perhaps they don't know they have to create suction by using the small lever on the cup.5) This is a sophisticated device with a lot of functions. The user interface is truly outstanding though and it makes it very easy to navigate among all these options.6) The device comes with localized menus. I got quite a kick when I configured it to use menus in my native language (Romanian).7) The satellites are acquired fast, even indoors (in a wooden house, for example). Obviously though, don't expect to receive the satellite signal if you're under a concrete structure or under a metallic roof!8) The maps are excellent and with a lot of detail. It was very useful to see the upcoming road curves on the map while driving at night, at high speed, on a remote highway in Utah! However, don't expect the map to be 100% accurate - I found that a local highway from a rural Vermont area was missing.9) Unfortunately, this device doesn't have a USB 2.0 interface so it takes *forever* (2+ hours) to fill the 700M of available memory with mp3 files! I purchased a high speed 2GB SD card to store my music files.

review_title: You can't go wrong with this unit
review_text: I borrowed a friends C330 unit and found the Garmin to fit my needs. That unit works good, but its size was too big. I did lots of GPS research and decided that the Nuvi 350 would meet my requirements. Amazon's price was the best I could find for a new unit. I like the fact that it comes with both AC and DC chargers and also the custom case to keep it protected. I wish that the full manual would come in printed form, but thats not a big issue. Bottom line is if you need a quality GPS/navigation system, this unit will meet most needs.

review_title: Nuvi Convert
review_text: I'm a fan of the Hertz Magellan Neverlost system, but the bi-modal reviews of the Magellan Systems gave the impression that there were prodcution quality issues.Next, I was going to go for the Garmin 2720. It can be fitted with dead reckoning, but needs wiring to the car. Reviews made me realise, my main reason for buying a GPS was not to use on my car, but on business trips and hence rental cars. So portability was key, and the Nuvi has the best form factor. To lug a 2720 (with laptop, files etc) on business trips would make things just the bit more heavy.In addition to the good points given by other reviewers, I must say the mount is excellent. It sticks well and because the Nuvi is so light, the mount does not have a lot to do to stick there. Also, the cigarette lighter power can cleverly be plugged straight into the mount and not the unit. To mount the Nuvi, you have only to flip the antennae up (activating the GPS) and clip it on. It powers up straight away. Then, when you get out, all you've to do, is press a small clasp release on the mount and out pops the Nuvi. It even switches itself off after 30 seconds.You can also put the Nuvi in "search mode". While driving on the free way looking for food or lodging, you only have to press "where to" and then press say "lodging". The Nuvi gives you an list of hotels, motels, hostels near you. It also provides distance and arrows showing whether they are ahead or behind your current position. The list updates itself every few minutes as you move along. See something you like? Just press it and the "GO" button and Nuvi takes you there. It was a life saver when we were travelling long distance late at night and needed somewhere convenient to stay.Finally, this is one gadget that my wife loves. When on holidays, she invariably ends up the navigator. Its stressful for her and things get heated up when I make a wrong turn requiring difficult new instructions on what to do. Nuvi has changed all that. She just sleeps through, as the Nuvi announces its "recalculating" the route.But indeed, you don"t get a Map which you can load on your PC, there is apparently no way to plan/alter routes on the Nuvi prior to making a trip or to keep a record of your trips.Garmin has been excellent in addressing user feedback, so I am hopeful.BTW, I don't use the other functions such as MP3/calculator and would prefer the functionality on the GPS be improved rather than these functions. But that's just me since I still use a PDA.

review_title: Out of date now.
review_text: While this unit is currently out of date, it still works perfectly (7 years now). I have since purchased a newer version for my other car and will replace this one because it's more cost effective than buying a map upgrade. Most of my friends and family purchased other navi's due to pricing, but all I hear from them are complaints. I'll stick with Garmin.

review_title: Perhaps a faulty product!
review_text: After reading wondeful reviews about this product, we decided to invest in one. Sadly, the Garmin was unable to locate a satellite with ease at our home. We would have to drive down our road and wait for a signal in order to program it for a destination site. We discovered that the commands were frequently too sudden and eventually the Garmin lagged at least a mile with its driving directions. When all else failed, it was delightfully helpful in finding us a nearby restaurant when we got lost but was unable to help us find "home".We were too reticent to purchase a replacement product and will do more research about another navigator.

review_title: Get it
review_text: This is our 2nd NUVI. I got one because I travel and drive a rental car to work site or hotel in a strange town. Its so much better than Hertz never lost. Logical interface, good software - and suspect it can do more than I've used so far. I got this one for my wife so she would never be lost even though she mostly stays in town. Once I was going to the airport (ATL), the usual way - hit a bad traffic jam, took the alternate route, hit two more traffic jams - pulled off the highway, drove a mile or two and fired up the NUVI. It found the airport on back roads - no signage - and I made the flight. Highly recommend and from what I've heard software much better than other companies. Note - the 200 series doesn't have turn by turn voice prompts - the NUVI does. If you're by yourself that's really worth it. Remember this cost $900 when it first came out so at $365 its a bargain. Tell yourself that, its not a gadget, yeah, its not a gadget honey its a tool!

review_title: TomTom One XL Rocks!!
review_text: I travel to numerous cities in my work in aviation sales, and I bought this product in order to cut down on wasted time asking for directions, getting lost, missing exits, etc. The unit provides a time to destination featurs which allows me to call ahead and avise my next appointment when I'll be arriving as a courtesy.The satellite acquisition time is not an issue if you do what the directions tell you and plug the unit into your computer to allow updated satellite positions to be downloaed via the internet.The feature which enables the user to upload routes, preferences, etc through the computer keyboard makes programming a snap.Like other users have noted, it would be nice to include text-to-speech as a download extra or as part of the basic package.The wider screen of the XL unit makes programming through the unit and visibility a breeze.Battery life before needing to recharge has not been an issue, so far.Bottom line is that I'm quite happy with TomTom One XL and would recommend it to others.

review_title: Garmin 270 review
review_text: Tested the product and it works very well. The sale price was very inexpensive for a unit that can be used in the USA, Canada and Europe. The unit comes with a car power adapter and a windshield mount bracket - so I did not have to buy these separately. I really don't care about other bells and whistles, i.e. Bluetooth - so this unit is perfect for my needs. The unit does provide voice instructions. The only limitation is it does not tell the street name - but it really does not matter to me (I just turn left in 100 feet). It had one free map software download included. Unfortunately, I could only pick North America or Europe software, and not both. I chose the North America - since I would use it more (it took awhile to download even with fast internet connection). I highly recommend this product for a person that travels throughout North America and Europe and is on a budget.

C220 can do this but somehow not directly. Its operate system is not easy to use for green hand. Another prblem is when you enter subway or channel you will lost your GPS signal, there are so many lanes under the channel in fact. which is the right way?

review_title: 720 is not up to par!!!
review_text: I had problems with the 720 right out of the box. The included cd Home software needed to be upgraded and the download cut off the bottom half of the screen so you can't read the choices. Then the computer wouldn't recognize the 720 when plugged into the docking station. This took 4 hours of deleting software, redownloading updates etc. just to get the computer to recognize the 720. You have to go through this because you have to download software and map updates to get the 720 up and running. Now comes the real problem-the unit is inaccurate!!! The GPS is about 200-300 feet off!! It locates me in the middle of my neighbors driveway, and my home location is in the middle of woods on the west side of the neighbor, when I am actually on the east side. There was no way to get that corrected even with help of a very good tech support guy. Also when you go by an intersection the unit still shows you approaching it, again I would guess a lag of 200-300 feet in real time. We had a Garmin b-4 and it located you exactly, and was 50% more user friendly than the TomTom. The bottom line-buy the Garmin 360 and save yourself a lot of headache. That`s what I did today, the TomTom was returned!!! Tech support was very good but could not resolve issues.

My only complaint is that a manual IS NOT included and the necessity of having to download one from the web site. Would definitely give a high recommendation for the first time user of a GPS system.

review_text: Aces on this one. I was told by others that Garmin is the best, so I bought this one. We used it on a known trip just to check it's accuracy, and it actually put us on a better route. The "speaker" is loud and clear and you can adjust it. What I liked was the estimated time of arrival which adjusts to your speed, and it was accurate to within a minute. It gives you warnings before an intersection, and tells you when to make your turns. Easy to program and use.The only negative is the disc they give you for a permanent place to stick the device, the glue is worthless. Some states have restrictions on the window mounting so check before mounting using the suction mount.You could just lay it on the seat and listen to the instructions. Even though the screen is 3.5", it has a good vertical height and the screen is easy to see.If you do a lot of driving, then you might want to get a model that tells you about traffic problems and alternate routes.

review_text: I am very pleased with the quality and performance of the Garmin Nuvi-350.There is a learning curve to understand the many operations but with the manual and the easy touchscreen most features can be found. What I particularly appreciate is the "Google" like search engine which will find stores, malls, churches and whatever at your location or on your trip. The Nuvi is developing a huge database of owners who share experiences on-line and hopefully Garmin will use that feedback to continue improve the Nuvi's updates.KC0NPG

review_title: Couldn't live without it!
review_text: This device is fantastic. Right out of the box, it's extremely intuitive to use. Once you power it on, it takes you through the setup, and the menu options are easy to navigate. You do need to put the "antenna" up (notched out in the back when down - flip it up) so it can find the satellites to get started. You can look up grocery stores, banks, gas stations, anything - and it will get you there. The best thing about it is that if you are like me, with no sense of direction, and you're brain fried at the end of a long day, and in an unfamiliar location, you can just click "Go Home" and it will take you back home. I love it! Now that I have it, I couldn't live without it.

review_title: Good for the money
review_text: Since I'd rather be lost then spend $800-$1000 for a super, high-tech GPS; I researched and found the Garmin SP c340 to be an affordable alternative. I like that it tells you the name of the street you are turning onto. Some other units just say "turn right". The c340 will say "turn right at John Street". There are a few drawbacks with this unit: I found it does lose the signal if not mounted to the windshield; it takes a while to load its maps when running on battery; and you can't verify an address with the zip code. (if you can, i couldn't find it) I think if I had know about the zip code thing, I wouldn't have purchased this unit. All and all, its a decent unit for the money.

review_title: I'm Still Undecided
review_text: I bought the Nuvi 350 as a replacement for TomTom on my PDA, which uses a separate Bluetooth GPS receiver. I didn't like the separate unit, tangle of charging wires, and really liked the idea of the single unit, small size of the 350, as well as it saying street names.But after a few days of living with it, I'm not so sure I'm going to keep it. There are a bunch of things I REALLY miss from my TomTom:Advance planning - with TT you can specify your start and finish points, to find out how far it is from, say, my brother's house in St. Louis to Chicago. Not availalbe with Garmin, except on the $$$ 2820, I'm told.With TT you can make and save Itineraries, so I can advance plan, and save, any number of separate trips while sitting at home, planning all the side-trips I intend to make on my vacation. Each Itinerary can have /many/ waypoints, so I can specify exactly how I want to travel from here, to there, stopping at any number of places along the way. Not available on the Numi.May scrolling is far smoother on the TomTom, while the Nuvi jumps. Making turns with TT is smooth, while Nuvi jumps from one position to the next. Zooming at intersections with TT is very smooth, and it smoothly zooms out after manual zooms, but not with Nuvi.Nuvi's doing some funny things with routes. For example, my route from home to work was correct and as expected. But from work to home, Nuvi wanted to deviate from the best route 3 times, which would definitely have been longer distances and travel times.I prefer TT's route summary, after the first time you enter your trip. Gives you a chance to look closely at it, and see if it's going to go the way you prefer. And if it doesn't, you can always go back to inserting waypoints.The Nuvi certainly has its PLUSES:I do like the enunciation of street names, although it sometimes seems to have a lisp.LOVE the small, all-in-one size.The extras, like book reading, mp3 playing, etc. is nice.I am /hoping/ that the Garmin maps are more up to date; I know TomTom's are fairly old in some of my travel areas.So, I am really undecided. The form/size of the Nuvi is so nice, and the extra features are great. In a way I hate to get the only TomTom more or less equivalent in size, the TomTom ONE, as it only has the features I already have, other than all-in-one. But I REALLY prefer the way the TomTom works, the route Itinerary options, and so on - basically, what I'm buying the GPS unit for in the first place.Darn! I thought there was a perfect GPS unit (and by the other reviews, the 350 was it). But it's far from perfect, and I haven't really seen one that is. So - I am still undecided.6/29/2007 Update: Well, I just packed the 350 all up in the box to take back. Kinda sad, I had my Abba songs on it and a picture of my Healey as the splash screen. But I went through all the things my TomTom does, that this doesn't, and realized that THAT is what I wanted a GPS for, not for looking at pictures or listening to music. If I hadn't had a TomTom, I'd probably have been very happy with this. But not now. Sad, but it's gotta go back tomorrow. I'll really miss its neat size and form factor. But not when I'm planning a trip.

review_title: Many enhancements; time will tell
review_text: EDIT 10 March 2008 for those who thought my first review wasn't helpful (I sure hope you didn't buy one - and have trouble - after disagreeing with my review)TomTom GO 730 was announced at CeBIT last week. TomTom recognizes the shortcomings of the x20-series devices (detailed below) and fixed the flaws present in the 520/720/920).Based on my experience with the GO 910 (which I also own), it will be at least 4-5 months before the new "NavCore 7" software is stable.>>> This was proven correct with the announcement and demonstration of the x30 on 3 March 2008: [...]If you want to save money, it will soon be the time to purchase a GO x20 series device.ORIGINAL REVIEW:TomTom increased the functionality in the new GO 720 series (with speech recognition, built-in FM tuner, map/direction usability enhancements, Bluetooth audio out, and ability to record your own voice).However, TomTom has taken a couple of steps back, notably the reduction in storage (the GO 910 has a 20GB HDD with USA, Canada, Europe and Guam maps) and the "passive" mount with no audio or power connections. While the storage issue can be partially solved using SD cards, the passive mount is most likely in response to the mount issues that plagued the GO x10 series. This new design means that those who keep a mount permanently in their car will have to reconnect all cables each time they wish to utilize the device.

review_text: I use this GPS when I travel inside or outside the US. I carry it in my laptop bag. Last week we rented a car in the UK and it worked flawlessly. When we got back to the US, I put it in a rental car and it worked on this side of the Atlantic. It is a refurbished unit and it was very inexpensive. I purchased it because it covers all of Europe and North America. It doesn't have all the features the expensive units have, but it always finds what I am looking for. Overall- a great value for the price.

review_title: Go, TomTom!
review_text: TomTom is a viable force in GPS navigation. The price, added features such as spoken street names, real-time traffic, phone link, etc, are all great. I upgraded gto the GO 720 from a TomTom ONE XL (simply to get the street names)and it was as advertised. And the service from Amazon was the standard that I've come to expect from them. The only complaint is the winshield mount, but I haven't found any better from Magellan, either, so...

review_title: The NUVI 350, great item
review_text: The product is great. It has brought me to my destination with precise accuracy. Only complaint, is that one destination was a route #, and it didn't recognize it by the route number. There was a street name for that route number that it recognized, which I knew. If I needed to go to a place that I didn't know the street name, it may be a problem.....other than that, no complaints. Easy out of the box set up, clearly heard and visualized. I give it 5 stars!!

review_text: This GPS was awesome. My non-geek wife really appreciated it on her recent trip. It was extremely accurate and easy to use. 8hrs of battery are nice too. We preload our addresses and take off. Road trips will never the same! I highly recommend this product to anyone that needs to navigate streets solo. You'll save time and gas and you'll get lost less often, you'll know about how long it will take before you arrive.

review_title: Great GPS for the price!
review_text: The GO 720 is a great GPS unit and as other reviewers have mentioned it is essentially the same unit as the GO 730 after you connect it your PC and update it with the included TomTom Home software. I also had to contact TomTom support to request an updated map and found it to be a pleasant support experience. I sent an online request with a copy of my receipt and after a couple of hours TomTom support sent me a response with a free copy of the most recent map.As far as user interface and routing go, TomTom and Garmin are generally regarded as the best by most GPS review sites. It seems to be a personal preference. There will inevitably be a route that one will prove better than the other, so you will have to live with that.The GO 720 also has the option to add an external antenna and install the unit in the dashboard console if you like. Most GPS units in this price range do not have this option.Overall, I am very pleased with this unit and give it five stars.

review_title: Perfect and no drawback so far
review_text: I bought my Garmin last month. Before my purchase, I already did a survey and realized that this model is a good one. Through my usage of more one month, it turns out to be perfect, from the display brightness to voice volume. This model did provide "safe mode" which means you can't operate the menu when the vehicle is moving. That's a very good reminding. Totally, I am very satisfied by this Garmin.

review_title: So far it is great
review_text: I haven't used the Garmin Nuvi very long but I'm having a great time with it. I have had one problem with an address but come to find out that the address doesn't appear on mapquest either. It seems to take time for some new addresses to appear on the satelite systems. I love being able to press one button to get home after I leave my last client's house at the end of the day. In the past I have been so tired that getting out of neighborhoods at that point has been a challenge - reversing my mapquest directions did not work very well. Again, I have not had the opportunity to use the other functions of the system but am looking forward to trying them in the near future. This is my first GPS system.

review_text: I purchased this GPS and have found it quite easy to operate. I have owned 3 other brands and this one is the best yet for the features offered. Some of the other were quite slow on updates but Garmin keeps them coming. If you want a larger screen go to the 360 which has the same features but a larger screen. Highly recommended.

review_title: c550 - Good but Not Perfect
review_text: I've owned other Garmin vehicle GPS units and hands down they are the best brand you can buy. I personally wouldn't buy an in-dash GPS unit if it wasn't powered by Garmin.I did however find some disappointment in the c550. The feature I was most excited about was the bluetooth phone feature. To my disappointment, this feature doesn't really work all that great in all vehicles. My 2005 4runner has too much background noise when on a highway or interstate... virtually eliminating the use of the bluetooth. Those I call cannot understand what I'm saying. Maybe this feature works great in a high class luxury vehicle but not for me. It works better when I'm in slow traffice but I still feel I have to talk above my normal voice level for the other person to hear clearly.The mp3 player feature is also virtually useless. The music only plays out of the unit and the sound quality is poor. With the popularity of other mp3 players (ipod)... this feature is never used.The traffic fm receiver is cool but will only help you if you live in a big city. I live in a mid-size city and the traffic alerts are minimal. It might be very helpful in a larger city with more congestion. This feature is free for 90-days.The other features can be found in lower models like the c340. I'd almost prefer that I would have purchased that model over the more expensive c550.It all comes down to the features you want. If you need the traffic receiver and so-so bluetooth features... then this unit is for you. The navigation and quality of the product are what make this 4-stars. If you don't really need the added features... go with the c340. Same thing... minus the add-ons.

review_title: It is out dated and YES NO LONGER IN PRODUCTION
review_text: I got this yesterday..guess what, the maps are from 2005 so anything new the the last 2 year won't be on here.Please look at the dates on these reviews before you make your purchase. Think you can update this? Garmin was giving me a 10% on the 2008 update which cost about $66.00 and guess what else, the memory on the c330 won't hold the entire 2008 maps you have to choose from either 48 states, hawaii and puerto rico or canada and the boarder states. Do you really want that? I went out tonight and got the c340 it has the 2008 maps preloaded and ready to go, plus it has text to speech which enables it the say what street you are turning onto.

review_title: So Far, So good...
review_text: I picked up the c550 from another online retailer. It came in an OEM (plain white) box, but contained all pieces the standard-boxed unit comes with. Quick notes:- Acquires satellites much faster than my old Magellan RoadMate 700. Ready to go in less than a minute!- If used in 'map' mode, it shows the next road coming up. Would like to know if that road is on the left or right side, but that's just being picky I suppose.- 3D view is nice. Took some getting used to but I keep it in that mode now.- Battery life is outstanding.- The traffic feature is NOT INTEGRATED. It's part of the charger assembly. Had I known that, I may not have purchased this unit. When I read 'integrated' I expect it to be self-contained within the nav system.- Because the traffic feature isn't integrated, if you choose to go on battery power alone you lose the traffic feature. So part of the portability goes out the window, as far as I'm concerned.- Traffic monitoring is okay, but you have to have a route programmed in to get the feature, i.e., it won't give you traffic info on the road you're traveling on if you're in map mode.- I haven't tried the Bluetooth speakerphone yet, but will test it soon.- The POI feature is much nicer than some other systems I've tried. For example, if you query for restaurants, it will keep refreshing and updating your list, including distance and direction, while you move.- Estimated time of arrival nice to have.Overall, I'd buy this unit again. I picked over the c530 mainly for the Bluetooth functionality, but the traffic feature is nice as well. Too bad Garmin doesn't understand what 'integrated' means. I knocked off a star because of that.

review_text: Very good product for the money. I will never be with out one. Can't imagine with the more expensive ones do better. Have used it for about 3,000 miles of travel. A few times it wanted me to go a way that did not seems right but I'm sure it would get you there. It re-calculates quickly if you go the way you want to get you there. The Volume control is the poorest feature. It's difficult to adjust when driving. It does more then the instruction manual tells you.

review_text: I bought this unit over a year ago and it never left me stranded. It is easy to program and can be updated over the internet.

review_text: I had been using a Navman F20, but wanted the ability to update maps and have the trip computer. Saw the Garmin at an excellent price and bought it. Have used it on a couple of trips and it has been excellent.Nice feature is that it has an antenna input, I used the antenna that came with my Garmin 40 GPS, this allows me to place the head unit lower in the car and still get excellent satellite coverage. I made a holder that allowed me to place it in one of the cup holders in my wife's 2002 MINI. Easy to use and out of the way. Had to seperate the suction cup portion of the mount from the cradle part that attaches to the head unit.This is the only negative, would like a cigarette lighter cord that plugs into the head unit without having to dismantle the suction cup mount. California and some other states have banned windshield suction cup mounts.Overall a great little product and I am very happy with it.

review_title: A very nice GPS system
review_text: Very easy to setup and use. The product comes with everything you need to place the unit into a vehicle and begin navigating (car plug, windshield clip, etc.) Very customizable for how navigation is computed and how position information is conveyed. When you first turn the unit on, you need to have it optimally placed to receive a satellite signal otherwise it could take several minutes for it to locate its position, however, once it knows where it is the unit is very good at keeping track of its location, even if you put it in the seat or in a pocket. Don't expect to use this unit when walking, though. It will easily become confused about where you are and what direction you are traveling in.

review_title: great product,but a newer model is coming out
review_text: The nuvi 350 has all the features I thought I might want (except maybe a camera), but the next model the 360 looks even better. Do a search for the "garmin nuvi 360" on Amazon and you'll see that it looks just like the 350 but also has some other features, like the ability to make phone calls through it (provided your cell phone is Bluetooth enabled).I wonder if the Bluetooth capabilities are only for making calls, or if you can transfer data too. They both look like great products, but I think I'm going to wait until the nuvi 360 comes out.

review_title: Be a "local" wherever you drive!
review_text: First let me say that I have a MS in Geography so you might say I'm spatially oriented. I can read a map, even have drawn maps. I can usually find my way around in unfamiliar territory. That said, when traveling you often need to know what lane to be in before you turn, and even more important, in the NY or New England area, what lane to be in of the two or three turn lanes on the specific ramp...if you "guess" wrong, you're toast! So on this last trip we took to Maine from Virginia, we tested out our Garmin Nuvi 350, mounted on the optional bean bag mount (better than the windshield mount, in my opinion, due to less view obstruction). It got us where we needed to be with no stress, no mistakes, leaving us time to ENJOY the view rather than worrying about making a wrong turn. We even used the lodging features and found a good hotel right near where we expected to be that night in our trip. Called ahead, made a reservation...sweet...as I was conducting that operation in Freeport, Maine, a person walked by and commented how great these GPS units are. On one section of road in Massachusetts, we saw a young guy in a sports car ahead of us with the same unit as ours and his turn signal came on the same time ours did as he was following the route of "map lady"...that's what we've named her! Both my wife and I love "map lady"...and we'd never take a trip anywhere without her leading the way! I think this GPS device is one of the most valuable tools I've ever had...as good as having a cell phone, if not better! I would characterize it as very close to perfect...but a few things could be improved. One, would like the screen to be a tad brighter (perhaps bigger too would be good) and sharper in daylight, particularly full sun (not that you can't see it, it's just that when you have sunglasses on, it just isn't bright enough for these 55 year old eyes of mine). Second, I'd like to see a feature to add more waypoints in a trip (currently only one can be added). The reason for this is when traveling through Connecticut; we wanted to go on the Merritt Parkway, a very scenic and less congested highway than the selected I-95. The only selections in the unit are for the "faster" route or the "shortest" route...none for the "scenic" route...that would be a nice feature. My workaround method is just to make a number of short routes that take me the way I want to go...and then it was easy to customize the trip. We only came across a few instances where roads where mislabeled - in one case "map lady" said "take exit 23 H when the exit was 23 B...but not a problem since "H" was not an option. Bottomline, if you haven't bought one of these, do it now. And if you already have one, you are probably, like me, going to give one to all of your kids that drive so you can be less stressed when they are on the road traveling. My prediction is that when this unit comes down below $200, EVERYONE on the road will have one. Also, in looking into other places to buy the Nuvi 350, there was no better price than what I found on Amazon. The unit came in two days...right out of the box it worked perfectly giving us accuracy to 10 feet...didn't need to read the instructions since it's so intuitive. Even downloaded some POI files that indicated where speed traps are on the New Jersey Turnpike...and indeed when the beeping happened to us with a flashing Speed Trap Warning, we saw a cop had pulled a person over going the other way...how cool is that! So, go get this product right now, you won't be disappointed!! And Garmin, what is your stock symbol...I want to buy a few shares!

review_title: Almost perfect!
review_text: The Garmin c550 is very easy to use right out of the box. Just turn it on and go. It quickly finds satellites and is extremely fast in calculations and accurate. The only complaint I have is with the age of the built in mapping. Several roads which have been around for over 7-8 years are still not in the database and restaurants which closed down over 5 years ago still are. The Bluetooth functionality works great although I would recommend buying the external microphone unless you're driving a car which is very quite inside. Overall I definitely recommend this product!

review_title: Great buy
review_text: Great product. Used it to travel from Massachusetts to New York without any problems. It re-routes you when you make wrong turns or miss exits. The only issue I have with the system is that it sometimes, not always, gives you directions when you are almost at the road or intersection it is instructing you to take. You do get both the audio and the written instructions/direction, so that if you were not paying attention to the audio, the written information is on screen. I absolutely love the fact that the system provides the audio names of the street and roads it wants you to take, taking the guessing game out of driving. The maps may need updating, and I haven't attempted to update them yet. The GPS device is a little bulky to carry in your bag or pocket. It is a great system to have. I would buy it again.

review_title: Amazing from the Start
review_text: This product has been helpful on several occasions already. I tried it around town first to make sure it knew the best/quickest ways to get around and it passed with flying colors. It's built in avoid system is very nice for when you're low on cash and can't afford tolls. Very easy to use right out of the box. Screen is large enough to view from the farthest point on your windshield. The change from light to dark streets at night is an amazing feature, it tones down the brightness so your not binded everytime you look at it while driving down those dark streets. The sound quality is good, however if your like me and like listening to fairly loud music, you might need to check the screen more often to make sure you dont miss a turn. If you do miss a turn the GPS quickly gets you back on track the easiest way it can. I have taken it on long and short trips and hasn't let me down yet. This is a Great buy!! I'm now getting two more for my parents.

review_text: I chose this product for it's portability and ease of use. Operation is extremely easy, and directions are very percise. Easy touch-screen operation allows for quick programing of routes. Routes can be saved in "Favorites," for easy recall/re-use. Have not played too much with the "Travel Kit" features yet. Only drawback is that I have not figured out how to program or notify Garmin of corrections (i.e. locations changing names... Food Lion to Bloom). I assume there is a process that Garmin may have for this. I would also have LOVED an alarm clock feature for travel. All in all, after much research, I'm extremely happy with this unit. It fits my needs and does the job when I need it to.

review_title: How did I ever travel without it.
review_text: As this is the only GPS I have ever used I am unable to do any comparisons. I am able to say that this is a great device and makes traveling so much easier. On a recent trip across Texas my wife and I found the unit easy to use, accurate in giving directions (although it has a definite preference for interstate highways) and filled with useful information. There was no need to decide ahead of time where to stop or make reservations. Just ask the nuvi about upcoming lodging, call the phone number provided and procede. With this unit and a cell phone you are absolutely free to go anywhere with no worries about the route or destination.

review_title: Good function but some issues
review_text: The GPS itself works extremely well. The problems are with the accessories. There is no power port in the GPS but it mates through the base. The base is fragile. Also the the power cord leaves a lot to be desired. If a fuse goes out, it is easy to lose parts which will make the unit non-functional. Of course none of these accessories are easy to obtain replacements for. If not for these problems this would be a five star unit

review_text: I have had the RoadMate 760 in service for a week now. Very simple to get up and running. It has absolutely amazed me with what it can do. I travel a good bit and the 760 has been right on the money every time. If you are not careful it will put you right in the kitchen of your destination. Would I tell someone to buy it, you bet!

review_title: Newest Member of our Family
review_text: My wife got this for me for my birthday, after riding with one of her associates at work who had one. Little did we know that it would be the newest member of our family. We named it "HAL" after the computer in 2001: A Space Oddyssey, and we now regularly fight over custody, as we both travel for work. I originally wanted to get a car with built-in navigation, but HAL's portability has really come in handy. We can move him from one car to another, and he's flown with me on several trips and works great in rental cars (when you need navigation the most). Needless to say, it's on my wife's Christmas wish list. We've used HAL throughout the United States, and he has performed almost flawlessly. We have had one or two problems when we've encountered road construction, and his map is not completely up to date, but that is to be expected with any GPS. The screen is easy to read, the verbal directions easy to follow, and the database of roads and POI's is extensive. I do wish Magellan would update the map database a little more frequently (I read that it's about one every 18 months.) Otherwise, no complaints. We love it, and have no doubt that there will be more "HAL's" for the whole family very soon.

review_title: Excellent but not perfect
review_text: This is the second Garmin GPS I have owned. Have had the C340 for about 4 months. I find this unit a lot more accurate than the C330 and the having the street names announced makes all the difference in the world. Aquisition time and recaulculating are snappy. One phone call to Garmin phone support took only 4 minutes to reach the right person and question was promptly addressed.Cons: Volume is a tad to low for my hard of hearing ears. No software for Mac although I was told it would be available in the spring. My only other comment is that the final instruction to turn comes a bit too late if you are going fast or in a strange high traffic area.In conclusion a great product. Richard of Wichita Falls, TX

review_title: Points of Interest a huge letdown
review_text: I'll skip over all of the details of use and features so thoroughly covered by all of the other reviewers and confine my comments to the points of interest. They are abysmal. Truly awful. The points of interest database must be wildly out of date (I have the latest maps) or extremely limited in scope because you can not rely on Tomtom to get you to much of anything when searching by name. Example: trying to navigate to a Fedex Kinkos store in my area from a direction I don't normally come from the 720 was totally unable to find the store. I would have had to have known the street address ahead of time defeating the purpose of POIs.I've added many lists of POIs to the Tomtom hoping to improve it but no joy - it is useless to me when trying to navigate by name to a store, bank, etc.It is now headed for Ebay and I'm headed either back to Garmin or over to Magellan.

review_title: Nuvi a winner
review_text: Just received the 350 to replace my old c340 (which I gave to my wife.) Unfortunately the 350 came with 2008 maps, not 2009. I went to the Garmin website and, to make a long story short) was unable to even register the new 350 to get a free 2009 map update. I called Garmin and got a person after almost an hour on hold; she told me I need to talk with custormer support. A half hour later I got a nice lady named Margarite who took care of my registration, selected the new map, and even started the download for me. I takes about two hours to unzip and install the download. When Amazon.com writes that "nearly all of our navigators have the newest maps because of our high turnover," place the emphasis on "nearly." Beyond this glitch, the 350 behaves flawlessly.

review_title: 4.5 stars
review_text: The C340 is a great GPS system. I originally ordered a different GPS system, but the screen turned out to be way too small, and there wasn't touchscreen capabilities, only scrolling. Thank goodness I returned it. Not only does the C340 have a big screen and touchscreen capabilities, it also tells you the street to turn on (with enough time to spare) and the interface is very user-friendly.So why only 4.5 stars? The suction mount. I found out the hard way that it's not too dependable, unless you find the perfect place on the windshield to stick it to. After mounting it onto the windshield and giving it a slight tug, it seemed like it had a pretty solid grip. However, midway through the drive while I was turning, the suction mount along with the C340 just fell off. I understand that the system is pretty heavy, but I don't like expensive technology falling to the ground at random times, so I ended up paying extra for a dashboard mount.But other than that, the C340 is solid product.

review_title: Saved my life
review_text: I got G2D2 my GPS device for x-mas for a modest 799.00. I bitched and moaned but hey you know the old saying you get what you pay for. It came with this stubby little antenna you get a decent enough signal driving around in Brooklyn. Occassionaly I would loose my signal but eventually would come back up.I decided to purchase the Gilsson external remote, man what a difference. G2D2 became Kitt from Knightrider. Talking up a storm giving me directions in wooded areas, places with high buildings, and even parts of tunnels. I can't loose a signal to save my life. Most times my signal strength is blue which means 3 or more satalites.Kitt formerly known as G2D2 recently saved my ***. I was in Long island for R.O.H (Ring of Honor wrestling) to most geeks this past Sat. When my buddy and I arrived there was no snow, however we came out to the biggest snow "blizzard" in NYC history. Visablity was minimal. Lucky for me I drive a truck that can change to 4 wheel drive with the turning of a knob.You couldn't see anything but white pillows and cotton balls falling from the sky. I couldn't see but the GPS could see me and the road clearly. The audible directions as well as the chimes that come on when it was time to turn worked like a dream. My buddy watched the GPS and I watched the road. It was dark (12:20am) and we had to drive down a couple of wooded areas. I never lost a signal. We got so comfortable with the Gps ablity to get us around we went to dunkin donuts for a quick snack. Eventually we got back to Brooklyn and prepared for the storm.

review_title: So Simple, Just plug and go!
review_text: This unit is just plain great! I bought this for my husband who drives a truck for a living and he was rather upset with me. He has no clue how to use a computer or hook up a stereo or VCR, (you get the picture). I told him to give it a try and if he still didn't like it I would return it. The very first day, he called me, so excited that he was able to use it and it actually took him right to his destination. He LOVES it! It has always been accurate and he loved the fact that the antenna is built right in, so there is no additional installation. Now the man feels like a genius and wants to tell everyone about this great gadget that "he discovered". There aren't any bells and whistles to this model, it simply does what it's intended for and does it very well. Needless to say, everyone is very pleased with all aspects.

review_title: Phenomenal
review_text: This has completely changed how we travel. As an example, my wife and I were moving and we had one weekend to find a rental. We visited 13 rentals in two days across three different, completely unfamiliar towns...and we were completely aware of where we were and where we were going the whole time. Our move from AZ to PA was also a lot easier with this device. Voice speaking of street names is essential.Two cons. Occasionally, for no apparent reason, it sometimes takes a long while to find satellites. We're talking 3-10 minutes. Second, the point of interest database in Altoona, PA, is for whatever reason woefully out of date and inaccurate.

review_title: Good GPS Unit
review_text: Might want to consider the Nuvi 200W instead to save $$$. But this model works very well out of the box, and is easy to use. Maps could be a bit more updated. A bit large for carrying comfortably in pocket. Navigation works very well. Overall a good design, and a reliable product. Display is excellent. Display and other options pretty good. Would like to see an external mute button on these units.

review_text: This device is really amazing and very useful. Only "beware" I have to tell you: It is only as good as the person using it, so make sure you input the correct info, don't assume it can make arbitrary decisions to decode what you input! Ex. We drove about 25 miles out of our way returning to our motel on a recent trip because we input "motel" then picked the one we thought was ours without checking address carefully. Got a nice tour of Tampa Florida before deciding something was not right....

review_title: Glaring Limitations
review_text: Some things work fairly well - it doesn't do as good a job as my Toyota GPS, but it's ok in a pinch in a car that doesn't have a GPS to start with. I bought it for a trip to Italy, both driving and walking. The first thing I wanted to do with it was "go" to Rome and look around the streets where I would be walking to and from my hotel. It doesn't do that. Oh, it could, but the designers never thought of it. I can enter "Rome", but it tries to make a driving route to there from California. After a long while it bombs and says "out of memory", then takes me back to California. It's so stupidly single minded it is unable to just go view an area for a while. My Toyota in-car GPS is pretty darn limited, and unimaginative, but it will at least do that!Other things on this little device are similarly restricted. Perhaps if the developers spent less time putting extra junk on these things, like Bluetooth stereo music, and actually tried using the device as a map for a while, they would go "duh, oh, yeah" and finish the software.I hate products that don't fulfill their promise. This is one.

review_title: Ideal for my use!
review_text: Quick re-routing instructions remove any stress when encountering road construction projects. Sometimes directions on multi-lane highways splitting into various roads would benefit from including information on which lane to use prior to veering off the main lanes. Numerous languages and accents are included, which hopefully will not all have the slightly annoyed tone when "re-routing!"Mounting in the left lower corner of the windshield minimizes the visual sense of interference when mounting in the middle.For traffic, hotel, restaurant, and other information, additional software must be purchased. This is a very useful well-priced product out of the box.

review_title: Excellent GPS PNG
review_text: After much research I settled on the 720. The Garmin 660 looked good but not good enough. The 720 is an excellent PND. The screen is very crisp and bright. Easy to see in the day and the visibility is not affected with polarized sunglasses. Some opine that it's not as bright as others. They where probably unaware that it not only switches to night colors at dark but can also dim the day colors when not in direct sunlight. Very customizable. Voices, colors, menus, just about everything can be set just so. Fast fix. Never has lost it's position. Very happy with it.

review_text: The product is great. We used it on a trip and it was more than expected The only problem was when I received the unit it had the wrong cable for the car charging unit. If it wasn't for a friend who had the same unit and I was able to borrow his cable the unit would have been useless on the trip that I purchased it for. I am also a little disappointed with Amazon. I sent the wrong cable that was shipped with the unit back over two weeks ago and haven't received or even heard anything about being sent the correct cable.

review_title: I WOULD BE LOST WITHOUT IT...
review_text: I recently purchased the Garmin nuvi 350 GPS system. I have to be honest it is the first computer operated thing I have purchased that completely surprised me. I thought it would be difficult and clunky to operate, and that I would need a degree in computer engineering to use it, but it is everything and more than I expected. It is so easy to use, just plug it in, touch the screen to find where you want to go. Then listen to the instructions. The synthetic voice technology has progressed so much. I thought that everything would sound like Stephen Hawking but it is a very clear female voice that guides you on to your destination. The price was fantastic and well worth the money. I use the Garmin in my profession as a Pastor when I need directions for visitation of my parishioners as well as my frequent travels throughout the state. I would recommend this to anyone who fears technology.

review_title: Happy with 760 but not with 700
review_text: I bought Roadmate 700 first, and used about a few weeks until I returned the unit. I was generally happy with the gps, but my main reason for return was the poorly designed window suction cup. It fell off two to three times a day, and in the end I gave up of the idea keep placing it back, and replaced with another unit (Roadmate 700) that came with a different design of suction cup. This time, it held it better but still gave similar problems, only two to three times a week instead. But still it was a nuisance, so I returned it and got Roadmate 760 two weeks ago. The suction cup that came with this unit is a total winner. No problem whatsoever on my Hyudai Santa Fe. The software is also much improved so that I can do multiple entry of destinations etc. which was not a possibility before. Overall, I rate this product 5 stat because of the intuitive software, good database, good price and very visible screen (even in sun light), and highly recommend it.

review_title: Garmin Nuvi 370
review_text: Got this unit to replace my Garmin 360 that was stolen. Same look and feel as the 360 but it comes with a traffic receiver and the european maps preloaded.PROs Easy to use, very compact. Touch Screen is very crisp and clear. Fast and very sensitive satelite receiver. I cand pick-up a fix even inside my house or in an airplane (close by the window).It is more of what Garmin got us used to getting which is close to perfection.I started to appreciate and use the Garmin-Lock feature since my other Garmin unit was stolen from my car (unfortunately not locked). People do not realize that when a GPS is stolen the thief gets access to your favorite and home locations. The garmin lock prevents them to use the unit.Hands free feature is very nice. It'll download your contacts from from your phone and dial them at the touch of the screenCONs Inability to insert more than one via point when you plan a trip.Traffic receiver not very useful unless you live in a supported area (big city). Also the trafiic receiver is an external unit you need to plug in to the Nuvi and it doesn't work if the Nuvi is not in the cradle Would have made more sense to have it integrated. Hands free lacks voice recognition and it doesn't support "Voice Commander" from MS that I use on my ATT 8525. Also if you listen to an audio book and a call comes in the audio book does not stop so you have to go back afterwards to catch up what you missed.Unit came with outdated maps but Garmin will send you an update for free if you register the unit and call them up. Overall I'm very happy with this baby and would recommend it strongly. My 4 stars is because the CONs I mentioned above and actualy I would give it a 4 and 1/2

review_title: Amazing
review_text: We recently returned from a 4100 mile road trip after purchasing our Magellan RoadMate 700 GPS. We traveled from Wyoming to Milwaukee, Chicago, Shreveport, Dallas, Denver and back home. In all the maze of highways and byways, I only got off the plotted course twice which was my mistake both times.The system put us back on course in a heartbeat. Truly amazing technology. The only negative feedback we have is we feel the manual is vague and could be more detailed, but we didn't have too much frustration as a result.We had a technical question about the external antenna and was promptly given a satisfactory reply by e-mail. If the price seems high, remember,

review_title: Problems with satellites reception on Garmin Nuvi 370
review_text: Bought this Nuvi 370 March 2007. Worked fine just out of the box for 3 months. Then it started to malfunction and not receive satellites. Garmin replaced it with a reconditoned one. Out of the box the keybord of the second one was not working. Sent it back at my expenses and received a third one. Worked fine for 4 months and AGAIN stopped receiveing signal from satellites. I think they have a problemwith the receiving unit and Garmin is not admitting it. Hopefully my 4th will be OK. I am close to the end of my warranty. If it goes bad I will not buy an other Garmin.

review_title: Very Impressed
review_text: I am a sceptic....I was blown away. I am looking at new cars, and noticed the price tag of a installed Gps....$1500 to $2500(depending on how good you negotiate). I just got back from a 996 mile drive from Chicago to Hilton Head Island. The Magellan took me door to door. My kids nicknamed it Hallena. It kept its sinal 97% of the way. When it did loose signal, it came back within a few miles. It displays the route for you when it looses signal. It found gas, and food for the family on several occasions. I originally bought it for my wife, who is a realator. It takes her door to door with her clients. She doesn't have to do dry runs the day before. The clients get a big kick out of the way Hallena anounces the turns. The suction mount is surprisingly good. I haven't used it in the winter, but in warm conditions, its great. I usually write to complain. If you are on the fence, buy it. I don't think the upgrades on the 760 are worth the price. I would buy the 700.

review_title: very good, but not perfect
review_text: Really wonderful tool. It has saved me hours of aggravation. Easy to setup and program favorite places.Accuracy is generally spectacular, however it makes some mistakes - on rare occasions it has located addresses incorrectly and occasionally got things on the wrong side of the road. In contrast, on familiar turf its taught me some handy shortcuts. Detour feature is very handy -- helped me in rural Ohio farm country when my two lane road was closed for construction -- got me to destination with minimal additional mileage over completely foreign terrain.Navteq website allows you to report mapping errors. Likewise for missing, changed or incorrect POI's. In strange cities, POI restaurants may already be out of business. POI listings of chain/box stores and restaurants are incomplete.You have to be brain dead to miss the voice instructions -- usually at least 3 reminders before any turn.I've subscribed to audible books for a few years and the ability to play them on the unit is very convenient because it automatically pauses the playback for voice instructions.My internal speaker broke within 3 weeks, had to get an RMA -- internal speaker volume even at the top level is low for highway road noise -- but running sound through car radio with a cassette adapter is better than the internal sound system anyway -- even with speaker repaired.I'd buy it again in a heartbeat!!!

review_title: Excellent, Tested & Proven in Europe
review_text: I used the Nuvi 370 in December 2007 when for a business trip that brought me to Germany, Austria, France and the Netherlands. The map and the mapping software is very accurate. As expected, the pronunciation of non-American streets is incorrect but that is to be expected. The important thing is that as soon as my rental car left the Frankfurt International Airport, the GPS was up and running immediately and brought me to many beautiful European cities.Tips for a better experience:1. Put a drop of water (say from your Evian bottled water) on the suction cup before attaching it on the windshield. This will prevent the suction cup from falling.2. SLOW DOWN when you are about 2 or 3 miles from your exit. It's way to obvious but the reason why most people miss their exits (even with a GPS) is that they are driving way too fast. No, it's not the GPS's fault.The Nuvi 370 is absolutely worth the money. I've used it the US too and it's been flawless so far.Bottomline - works as advertised. The other most important thing that the unit has is the currency and unit of measure converter. The others (mp3 player, bluetooth) are regular add-on, not too impressive but maybe useful for other folks.

review_title: great item
review_text: I received this as a Birthday present. I have a GPS "built-in," in my other car, so I know how the expensive ones work and I am pleased with this portable unit. Nice looking, nice size, easy readability, and accurate. As this was a present, I can only assume it was much cheaper then my "built-in," but it does the same job. And, it has the portability to be used outside the vehicle or in another vehicle. I am very pleased with it!

review_title: bought two, one died hard after one usage
review_text: i trusted Garmin but this is really a very terrible experience with c330. My friend asked me to buy two for him and one died hard after only one usage: we tried reset button, we tried different ways of powering it up. But it completely died. have to return it for full refund. So for people planning to invest in c330, be careful and test yours once receiving it to make sure it works reliably and you can meet the 30-day return deadline if it does not work.

review_title: AWESOME!
review_text: I ordered the Garmin 350 after doing extensive research on Amazon, Consumer Reports and other websites that rated the product. I also did a test run at Best Buy where the sales person was telling a group of people that Garmin was the best from a satellite and maps perspective. The price of the Nuvi 350 was well over $100 more than at Amazon.com. AND, they were out of stock, which tells me that even over $100 more it was a good selling item. My motivation to purchase a GPS was due to getting lost in a very unfavorable/dangerous section of Philadelphia where as a female alone I was afraid to stop and ask for directions. I was using Mapquest directions that do not take into account construction detours.I have used the Garmin Nuvi 350 for several road trips since my purchase. I cannot be more pleased. Navigation through the unit is extremely user friendly. I simply type an address and hit "Go" and I'm on my way. You can add an additional stop to your route and incorporate it into the bigger trip. You can type in key words to a business you might be looking for and it will pull up all listings in the area with that key word. For example, if I am looking for directions or the phone # to Biltmore Winery, which is part of the Biltmore Estate, I simply type in Biltmore and choose from the list it presents me. The Nuvi will also give you listings by hotel or restaurant type and list them by their distance away from your location. You can chooose Chinese, Italian, Steak house, Fast Food, etc. Or you can choose ALL and see what is close to you.The voices are clear and audible on this unit. It is a cynch to snap in and out of its holder, which suctions to your window. It has a leather case to keep it in when you are using it on foot to navigate through the city. The colors are bright and friendly to the eyes. You can store a list of favorite places and there is a button for "home". Start up is quick and the routes that have been chosen so far are efficient. It may not choose the route that you might usually take, but it does choose good routes from my experience. It recalculates the route immediately if you take a different turn and get off the original route it provided for you. I traveled to Portland, OR to visit a friend. I programmed his address into the unit and from there was able to drive my friend to work, go sight seeing on my own, drive back to his work and pick him up and drive straight back to his home. This was no easy feat with all the turns, interstates and highways that I was not familiar with. However, with the Garmin Nuvi 350 it was so simple to navigate through traffic without a worry. It was incredible. I would be lost without it! No pun intended!One thing I have noticed, which would be the same with any GPS I imagine, is that when you are parked in a totally enclosed parking garage it takes a moment for the unit to calculate your route. You must get out of the garage into an area where the satellites can reach the unit in order to calculate the route.Overall, I am absolutely thrilled with the Garmin Nuvi 350. I am not a person that would score this unit less than a "5" b/c of lack of reception in an enclosed parking garage, which would most likely be the case with any GPS unit. The benefits and features, ease of use, feeling of safety for me and my service from Amazon make this product a solid "5" in my opinion.

review_title: Garmin Nuvi 350 - Love it!!
review_text: I purchased this navigation system at the reccommendation of a friend. I am a person who gets lost very easily and has no sense of direction. I recently moved to a new state after living in the same town since my birth 45 years ago. Needless to say I was terrified of trying to find my way around a new town in a new state. From day one I have had the confidence to go out everywhere with the help of my Garmin Nuvi. The voice tells you when to turn, names of streets, everything. It was worth every penny. I would be LOST without it. Great product! I highly reccommend this.

review_title: CAN'T BELIEVE THE VALUE
review_text: This GPS has everything that you could want! I can't believe the accuracy and the maps have information on the smallest of backroads and private streets. I was reluctant to buy one that didn't have preloaded maps, but I was shopping price so I tried it. I had the maps loaded and the unit ready to go in 15 minutes! Compare to units at twice the price, I can't imagine how they could be any better. I was able to load seven states on the supplied memory card, and I like the idea that in the unlikely event that I should travel outside of that area, I need only upgrade the memory card. An unbelievable value!!

review_title: Must have GPS
review_text: I did quite a bit of research before purchasing the Garmin Nuvi 350. After receiving the 350, I can say this is truly an awesome gps unit. The 350 is quick to respond, easy to use, and accurate. The only drawbacks I see are the somewhat long startup time and the inability to add a detour ahead of time. You are only allowed to detour a route as you are coming to it. Aside from this, I think the Nuvi 350 is great and would recommend it for anybody looking for a gps unit. Note: I do not use any of the other features (e.g., pictures, mp3, etc) so I have no comment on them.

review_title: Easy navigation
review_text: This product is very easy to use and set up. Typing in an address (whether it's in Italy, Denmark or Washington D.C.) is fast and accurate. It's preloaded with a suitable amount of points of interest.The screen is incredibly clear and the instructions are easy to follow. The relatively small size of the screen is no problem at all.The navigation worked very well, no serious problems have been found. I've tested it in the US (east coast) and in Denmark (Europe) no problems anywhere, only a slight dificulty in accepting a high occupancy vehicle lane in the middle of the road (the computer figured I was going in the wrong direction!) but that was no problem in pratice.It's a simple, foolproof navigator that works well; not many fancy extras but who needs that? Definitely recommended.

review_title: RoadMate 700 -- Expensive, but worth it!
review_text: I've been using the "built in" GPS in my Lexus for more than a year, and I've found it so useful I wanted one for my wife's car. Having used the RoadMate 700 for a couple of months now, I can say that I'm very happy with it. It lacks a couple of features that my "built in" system has, but otherwise it works very well. The only downside I've noticed that it takes a little long to recalculate a route if you've strayed off the original route; my "built in" system responds within a couple of seconds, while the RoadMate can take up to a minute. All in all, it's a good system and I'm happy I bought it.

review_title: Some people are very misleading
review_text: To the reviewer below from Tualaton:Too bad it didn't work out for you. But just to clarify some mis-leading points (using your numbers)1. Agreed. Tech support needs work2. Check your cig plug. Most power issues have to do with auto cig plugs that are a little too small. I never had problems, but I use a Radio Shack swivel 2-1 adaptor (use the radar detector at the same time) that works great.3. The sound on these units is the loudest and clearest out there. I'm really baffled by your comments on this one.4. Yes there is. You can add any address at any time to favorites. If you're talking about way points without an actual address, there's even a way to do this, although not as easy as on the Garmin.Check out the tips on gpspassion.com5. Yes there is. The Roadmates will be upgradeable via USB or CF, and will have updates annually.6. Read some of the many other posts and realize that Magellan gives their gooseneck mount free. It is an excellent mount, but yes, I agree with you that multiple mounts should ship with a unit of this price.7. Auto contrast may be hard to notice. My unit is easy to see in all types of light, even bright sunlight with sunglasses on. You do know those settings are adjustable, don't you?8. I rarely lose blue WAAS lock, even in the city. I've driven through really bad storms, including heavy sleet without losing it. It's an known fact that weather has little affect on GPS. If you can't get a good signal, maybe your unit was in fact bad.

review_text: Moved to small unit - was using Streets & trips on laptop with a blue tooth receiver. Took too long to setup (unpacking laptop etc) for short trips so I ran into trouble occasionally. I'll focus on what I find convenient on this 1. Hotels - as I'm driving along interstate I can find hotels at increasing distance from where I am - phone numbers are there - I can dial through bluetooth on unit & phone. 2. Restuarants - in area you don't know, can search out in distance from where you are - find type / style / chain you want to go - hit the place and your route is mapped out.Has only steered me wrong once - in rural Wisconsin a road had changed so it had me for a short period on a dead end road. Easy to "force" your way out of it, start heading in direction you know you are heading (West in this case) and soon it "reroutes" you and the dead end road was out of the picture.Much better than laptop alternative for me all round. I haven't used Europe maps yet, or the traffic alert information. Startup time could be a bit better - but it does have to acquire the satellites.

review_title: Four 1/2 Stars for me
review_text: I live in Manhattan and have used the Garmin 350 Nuvi for about a year. On narrow streets, it's hard to get the initial satellite connection. It's even worse if you're moving. It was able to achieve satellite connection best at an intersection. The Garmin does not work well under scaffolds (duh!).Also, I find in major highway intersections (I'm talking about crazy roundabouts, twists, multi-layered highways such as the "intersection" of the West Side Highway, George Washington Bridge, I95 and, I87), the Nuvi is at a loss. It helps at times like these to pay attention to the purple path delineated on the Nuvi.Also, the OEM suction mount is absolute garbage. Leave it in the car on a warm day, and it turns into a messy goo. I replaced it with a bean-bag like dash mount, which has worked fine, but it costs an extra $30.Garmin Portable Friction Mount for Nuvi, StreetPilot I Series & C530, C550 (010-10908-00)For the price, you cannot find anything better. And I felt this way a year ago when prices on this thing was $600. I took the Nuvi to Toronto, CA, and it saved me many times. So in that trip alone, I thought the purchase was worth it. So, the NUVI is not perfect, but the interface is better than most, and definitely worth the money.

review_title: Very useful but needs improvement
review_text: This is the first GPS I have owned but I have used other GPS before in Rental cars and in-car GPS. Overall I will recommend this GPS.Review:1) Maps were quite up to date and Garmin provides the free update for the latest maps for 2008. To get the update one has to register in the Garmin's website and provide the serial number of the device. It takes around a month to get the update from Garmin.2) Routing is very good but sometime it is slightly incorrect or quirky. The device routes me through two different routes from my home to the highway without any specific reason. Though the distance is very similar, one of the roads has more traffic light and is slower. I am yet to find a reason why the device choses one route over the other on certain days.3) The text to speech is really useful. You don't have to take your eyes off the road to check the map to make the turn.4) Bluetooth phone integration works very well. The audio quality is not the best that I have heard but it is definitely better than most of the bluetooth speaker phones. Coupled with that you can enable the Bluetooth "push' feature if your phone allows it. This enables you to see the phone's directory on-screen along with call history. The coolest feature that I have found is to able to listen to the SMS that you receive while driving.5) Traffic routing works well in my area i.e "San Francisco Bay Area". I have also used the traffic routing in Denver and it worked very well. Although the traffic system needs few updates which I believe is possible since TMC provides these information. The traffic incident report is typically quite vague. It says "slow traffic" or "accumulating traffic" on the highways. It will be much more useful if the actual speed on the highway is also mentioned. I have seen that sometime the slow traffic implies 20 mph and sometime it is 50 mph. It is often very difficult to decide to avoid the traffic bottleneck based on these information. Also the time taken for the traffic information to update is slow. It is almost close to realtime in my experience for building up the traffic delay but it takes way more time to clear the incident report. I think this will help if Garmin includes speed data in the traffic report.6) The suction mount works well. My car has a flat region on the dashboard so it was much easier to mount.7) GTM-12 traffic receiver is not integrated in the GPS. Often it is a hassle to connect the traffic receiver.8) POIs are not that extensive.

review_title: like it.... wish I wait for price drop
review_text: I like the Nuvi 350 better b/c it is thinner but the price was higher than I would like to pay for. I bought the C340 for $470. Now Nuvi just drops to $540. Overall C340 is a very nice unit and it works quite well - took it on the soccer trips and found the field easily. Some limitation on new streets that are not yet updated on the map. It does not have a "remember this location" kind of feature. The unit is too heavy and keep drop down from the windshield. I may need to buy a sand bag to keep it on the deck instead. the software will remember your trip but it does not allow you to delete a specific one. Need more competition to lower the price

review_title: Unit is nice and works well... Customer support is really terrible.
review_text: The unit is a good value and well designed. If you need to call Magellan for anything, watch out. You'll spend a long time on the phone with someone who knows nothing about your unit. I wish the website had all the questions and steps that they were going to ask you to take. Even their sales department is clueless.

review_title: Terrific
review_text: The Garmin c330 is just what I wanted. My first impression was what a neat toy. Then on a trip I discovered just how impressive it really was. I needed rest areas and learned just how far away they were. I needed gas and got rapid results. Then when hungry, I got muliple suggestions on where to get food. All of this with turn by turn directions which allowed me to get in to the proper lane, and return to the route I was on with ease. I also appreciate hearing the voice which allows me to focus on my driving especially when in heavy traffic. Terrific product.

review_title: Even a Caveman Could Use It
review_text: VERY easy to use and accurate. Didn't have to refer to the manual at all. I think the volume could be better as it is hard to hear with the radio on. I also think various route choices would be nice, as my wife has in her new Camry. All in all, an excellent product for the price. If I had to buy another one, I'd buy the c340 ONLY because it has much better synthesized voices (like Emily, the female British accent). We had a c340 before and it was stolen and I didn't think an extra $100 for the traffic reporting was worth it, but now I think it is only to get the voices.

review_title: Place to place with ease
review_text: Took me from SE FL USA to my brothers doorstep in SC USA no problem. Route was a bit long...map is already dated. You can go a better route using a map....but I made my trip without a map or a hitch. I just listened to it.Screen is great. Touch screen great. Ease of use great.A bit pricey though. Also look into the i2, i3, or i5.The maps cannot be changed. They are preloaded. So very soon it's out of date.Some other models..."cheaper models"...load selected map data into memory card. These models have small cards, but bigger ones are cheap on the net.If you have money to burn, go for it.I am opting to try out the i2 though. I don't use it except for occasional long trips or occasional hunt for new local place. So you have to weigh the cost with the use if you are budget minded.Stick to Garmin. They are easy to use and have good support. A "con" is phone support. Average wait times are over 30 minutes.Go to the Garmin site and look over product manuals. And search the net for reviews and such. DO RESEARCH.I have tried other brands, Garmin is goodness.

review_title: Great for the USA, good for Europe
review_text: I bought the Nuvi 370 initially for a 3 week vacation in Europe.USA: I tested it out for about a month in Pennsylvania and Ohio and did not get lost once. The POIs are good for golf courses, shopping, and landmarks (museums, historical POIs, etc). The satellites were recognized within 30 seconds while standing still and beginning to drive. I used it mounted in a car and while walking with few problems with bearings. The pedestrian mode works well, but you can be misdirected if you are not moving for a short amount of time.Europe: I also used this for about 3 weeks in Germany, Austria, and Italy. The satellite coverage did not seem to be as top-notch as it is in the US. It could take up to 2 minutes to recognize your position. This could be a small problem if you're in an urban area trying to get somewhere efficiently.I used this in Berlin, Rothenburg, Nuremburg, Fusen, and Munich in Germany. The Autobahn was easy to travel on with this GPS unit, but POIs other than shopping and landmarks were not there (e.g. gas stations). In the towns and cities travel by foot was a bit more of an issue (see comment above). There were 1-2 strange calculations in Berlin (most likely due to construction) and Munich. I did not get lost, however, since I stayed the course it had originally calculated.In Austria, I used it in Salzburg and it worked really well. Landmarks were the only problem since I was on foot in Salzburg.In Italy, I used it in Venice, Florence, Padua, Verona, Assisi, and Rome. Since these were all visited via train, I only have comments about pedestrian mode. Rome and Venice were easy to traverse on foot with the 370. Florence was a bit of a problem since it was more difficult to figure out which street to walk to with the many plazas there. (Street signs are on the sides of buildings if you've never been to Italy). Assisi, Padua, and Verona are smaller geographical areas, so the landmarks were easy to find.Summary: I would have given the 370 five stars if it would have performed as well in Europe as it does in the US. Remember to know the names of any sights you want to see in their native languages prior to leaving for your trip (this will save you a lot of time). Loading in additional addresses to your favorite locations is easy. Still, realizing that the accuracy of domestic GPS units is much better now than a few years ago, I guess I cannot complain. The military satellite accuracy is what the private companies need to strive for, but then again we would most likely see that cost in the price of the end-user units.I did, however, have to send back my GPS back to Garmin since the windshield mount power supply/FM traffic receiver outlet did not work. Their customer service has been great so far.I received the new unit back and it works at 100%. The traffic receiver function was the issue. It comes with 3 months of service, but it can be purchased for $60/year from Clearchannel in the US. MSN has a service with the 680 model, but it seems to be a young area of growth. So far I cannot comment on the accuracy of traffic, but it picked up major construction in my area.

review_text: I've owned a Nuvi 270 for about 2 years and I am very pleased with it and would recommend it to others. I've used it in about 6 different European countries and about 10 US States and find the database to be very good.Ease of use is excellent - the unit is intuitive to use.I've only ever experienced minor issues, rarely does it fail to pick up satellites within 30 seconds for me in about 5000 miles of use (there is an odometer on it!)

review_title: Look no further this is a great portable navigator
review_text: I've had this for a few months. I didn't get it from Amazon and when it arrived it was DOA. I called Garmin tech support (I did have to wait a while) and they were extremely helpful. I was concerned that since I didn't buy it from an authorized dealer, I would have some problems. But I didn't. I didn't even have to pay for shipping. They sent me a shipping label and I had the unit back within a week. I bought the 512mb card and could load quite a bit of of the mapquest. It did not take too long and is probably calculates more quickly than the hard drive of the 330.I've had no problems with the window mount. It's been there for over a month and not loose at all. I put a screen protector on it to avoid any scratching. One thing with the screen, if you wear polarized sunglasses, the screen can be difficult to see, so when something important is coming up, I'll take off the sunglasses and the screen is very visible even during a bright sunny day.I love the 3D mode. I think it is easier to see how far ahead a turn is going to happen, especially when dealing with a bunch of ramps.The software is quite good too. I commute to Philadelphia and I have learned some shortcuts with the 320 which was especially helpful during the transit strike. It was also great when driving to Newark, NJ airport. It had the different terminals listed and the directions were right on. It recalculates when you go off route quite quickly. One time I had it set for shorter distance rather than faster route and I was not going the way Darla (my anthropomorphic name for the 320) told me to and there were quite a few exits close together that she was trying to get me to go on plus there were roads above me too. She was having a nervous breakdown and kept saying "recalculating, recalculating, recalculating..." Finally I just turned it off to give her a break. When I turned it on again, I changed the mode and there were no more problems and it worked just fine.I recently got a new car and was debating on getting an onboard navigator but decided against spending close to $2000 for it when I had the 320. I can move the 320 to other vehicles with no problem.Unfortunately you can't put in waypoints and save routes. For the waypoints I use my GPS for geocaching.If you're looking for a car navigation system, look no further. This one is great. I used to use my GarminV which just beeped when a turn was about to happen and it was harder to tell where the turn was especially if there were a couple of exits close to one another. Darla talks to you and she speaks quite a few different languages or with a British accent.

review_title: Don't buy it!!
review_text: Although you're looking at the Magellan 760, let me share with you my experiences with the Magellan 700.I have used the Magellan 700 to get from point A to point B. When it works (actually powers on), it will do the job. However, so will just about every other NAV unit on the market.The problem is, when your unit fails (and ours did three times withing the first year), you will deal with the worst customer service on the planet!Our unit broke within 30 days of purchase. The unit's power would simply shut off while driving down the road (and right when you need it the most!). Sometimes, the unit would not even power up from the start. It also would search for the satellite and often lose our location. We tried changing car power adapters, etc. but no go. Fortunately, the first time this happened, we were still within 30 days of purchase, so Amazon was nice enough to send us a replacement unit. However, when the unit would not power on for the second and third time (a few months later), we had to send it back to Magellan.When you call Magellan, you speak with a customer service rep in India! Every sigle phone number that you dial is routed to India! Unfortunately, they have no clue how to help you. To send your unit back for repair, you need to wait for an email with shipping instructions. The problem is, that never comes! In my case, I called them 7 times over the course of 10 days trying to get my shipping instructions and RMA. I begged them for an address and RMA number via phone so I could send it back (and I offered to pay for the shipping), but they will not give it to me. Each time I called, I was told that I would receive the email within 24 hrs.....but nothing ever shows up. I even gave them alternative emails to send to...but nothing.Amazingly, you cannot even speak to a supervisor to resolve your problems or anyone in the US for that matter. You are simply stuck in an endless loop!As I sit here today, I am holding my broken Magellan.....waiting for an email that probably will never come. My warrantee is quickly running out and I am blindly finding my way around town.Please....I beg you to consider a Garmin or a different brand NAV....don't buy anything from Magellan!!! When this thing works, it's fine. But if it breaks (and it likely will), then good luck getting it fixed!You have been warned!!

review_title: Superb Device
review_text: I've had this little guy for over a year and used it extensively in the US and Europe. It is one of those few gadgets that makes you love it. Sample conversation (on the way to the car): "Hey darlin', don't forget the Nuverooni." I bought the language software and the Europe "travel guide" data -- I haven't found either very useful. But the basic device is 6-stars! Too bad Amazon only allows 5. I haven't used a 660, but I think it might be too big for my pocket -- the 350 is small enough that I pop it in a jacket pocket and carry it around. Great for marking the location of your parked car in an unfamiliar city.

review_title: Magellan RoadMate 700 Horror story!
review_text: I got a e-mail today from Amazon to write a review on this produt I just bought. So here goes. I bought the Magellan RoadMate 700 NEW. It was shipped from Car Toys. When I plugged it in it was not ready to go as advertised. A error message came up stating it did not have the software installed. I called Magellan customer service told them the story & they shipped me a new Magellan RoadMate 700 in exchange for the broken one. I plugged it in & it was ready to go. I used it for a day. Next day when I fired it up, it never got past the user prompt. It frooze. I called customer service again told them the story & they exchanged yet another Magellan RoadMate 700. It has been a month since the last exchange, the Roadmate operates as advertised. This is a good product, you need to be lucky to get one that works on the first shot.

review_title: Works Great - Needs Some Enhancements
review_text: There is no dearth of reviews here. This is a different take on the product. I give it 4 stars because of some unpleasant surprises and some basic things that I believe the product should have designed in.I bought the c340 prior to taking a family vacation by car to Northern California and Oregon.How the C340 made the vacation more pleasant- Less arguments between my wife and I on driving directions- My kids could watch DVDs with the player plugged in to car charger. The C340 has a battery that lasts for many hours (Check if the other products have a battery - otherwise you can either operate the GPS unit or the DVD player and face the consequences of "When are we going to be there?")Pleasant Suprises:- Very good coverage of navigation for most destinations from Lassen National Park to Crater Lake to Bandon, OR to Florence, OR.- Type in the address of a recommended restaurant from Frommer's guide in Eugene, OR and be accurately directed to a scrumptious lunch- It's quite remarkable how the unit can accurately "predict" your arrival time.Unpleasant Surprises:- The mount was not sticky. The unit fell off a couple of times. Till I applied some good old spit to the rubber that attaches to the windshield and it was "more sticky"- The town of Mt.Shasta was not accessible. I tried many different ways. I would have expected Mount Shasta to be a city in California and not "non-existent" in the Garmin database- Navigating to a Starbucks in Klamath Falls,OR took me to a Safeway.So, okay, Safeway allows Starbucks to brew coffees in their store but I don't think of that as a Starbucks location. More on that below.What I would like:- I was looking for WiFi hotspots along the way. I had to keep typing in Starbucks over and over again. I wish I could just enter Starbucks one time and store it in my favorites. Everytime I was looking for Starbucks, I would just need to go to my favorites. I expect others might have Chevys or McDonalds or Denny's in their favorites. This would be a good enhancement.- THere is a squiggly line to the lower left hand side that neither the manual nor the unit explains. It looks like bars on a cellphone. Either explain what it is or get rid of it.- Show the altitude of your location. A GPS can compute that. Great car conversation with the kids - Do you know what the altitude of Lassen National Park is?

review_text: This is a excellent GPS unit for people who are looking for just GPS and no fancy stuff like Bluetooth, MP3 etc. Buy 1 GB SD card to store full America Maps in that, it will same as C330.Cons1. First time it takes some time to connect to satellites (app 2 mins).2. It alarms at .9 mile then .4 mile and then just before 200 m to the turn. The last one did not give you time to correct yourself.3. If you stopped in between to fill gas, getting back on your route is not 1 click.

review_title: Garmin too good?
review_text: Just returned from the Dordogne region in S.W. France. I am a first time GPS user. Our Garmin nuvi 370 was superb, especially in dealing with complex city addresses. We had it set for the "fastest" route. However, when in the country area, the Garmin seemed to take us through every small back road compared to more simplified and direct directions suggested by maps. Some of the roads actually stopped halfway into somebody's farm. You can get very dependent on this machine, give up the use of good maps, and use a lot of gas following the Garmin device.

review_title: Highly recommended
review_text: I received this unit as a Christmas gift and I highly recommend the unit. I took a drive to a rural area within an hour of opening the gift and it couldn't have been easier to use. I plugged the unit into the power adapter - it took about 90 seconds to download from the satellite (a one-time activity) and it was ready to use. I had not read any manuals and I found it intuitive to use. I was able to put in the address I was headed to and it quickly calculated a route. it wasn't the route I normally took so I turned a different way and it immediately recalculated the route without further input. The unit speaks in a variety of voices and it does give you the name of the street you will be turning on. Very simple to use.The only thing some people may find as a negative is that the pronunciation is not always accurate. However, to offset any confusion, the street name is also displayed on the screen. I haven't downloaded any new voices but I look forward to exploring that aspect of the unit as well!!

review_title: Help! My Nuvii is Possessed!
review_text: My Nuvii 350 is possessed! Unfortunately, not by anything intelligent. I'm constantly getting lost in my car, so I bought this to help relieve the frustration and high blood pressure. It works fine, just so long as I know where I'm headed and which way to turn ahead of time. Otherwise, I'm in trouble.A few weeks ago I told it to locate the nearest plant nursery. Three times out of three, it merrily led me into the middle of residential areas where there has NEVER been a nursery, and never will be. I asked it to take me to the closest Home Depot, and it happily gave me directions to an empty lot.Today, things got even stranger. First it took me off the main street where I was traveling and looped me around in a residential area, then led me back exactly to where it'd turned me off, and had me continue the same direction I'd been going! Then it led me a mile past my destination, turned me around, and then led me back for no apparent reason.I judge satisfaction for this device by how often I want to kiss it for saving my life vs. how often I want to smash it with a hammer and send it back to its manufacturer, and right now, the hammer is looming larger and larger.My next purchase will NOT be a Garmin!

review_title: Great Deal for the Money
review_text: A $199 price point has been the holy grail for retailers for a nice touch-screen GPS unit, and Magellan has done it with the Maestro 3100. I have been using this unit for about one month and am totally pleased with how it operates. The touch-screen works great and the interface is easy to figure out and navigate. I have never looked at the manual. The inclusion of the Sirf Star III chipset means it gets a quick fix and will even work indoors. Using the Navteq mapping software means that the roads are up-to-date. As far as all the other bells and whistles (Bluetooth, MP3, etc.), do you really need those? I have other devices for those purposes. This unit is designed to get you from point A to point B with no hassles, and it delivers. I only have a couple of minor complaints. One, it is slightly difficult to attach the unit to the windshield mount. It just seems like a poor design. Two, it will occasionally lag when navigating. This is particularly evident after you enter a new favorite and click the return arrow to go back. It can take 8-10 seconds...no big deal. Bottom line, this is a great deal for a name-brand GPS.

review_title: Reliable and easy to use.
review_text: I've used this GPS extensively over the past month and I'm really pleased with my purchase. This unit has some definite advantages over other GPS units that I've seen. The most important is probably that it announces street names. For example, it will tell you to "Turn left onto Main Street in .3 miles," not just "Turn left in .3 miles." If you don't know an area, that's a real advantage. The GPS units that don't tell you street names can leave you wondering, did it mean turn at this light or the last light? If you do make a mistake, it immediately alerts you by announcing "Recalculating!" and then gets you back on your route. The unit is small enough to be hand-held and can be used by pedestrians as well (although I have not tested this). The screen is small, but easy to see. The GPS units with larger screens give you more lateral view, but this doesn't seem too helpful since you're always traveling forward, not sideways. All the maps are preprogrammed, so you're ready to go anywhere in the United States, Canada or Puerto Rico, although I've only tested my unit in the US. Its knowledge of the all the streets is pretty amazing. Even tiny little alleys and side streets are recognized by the unit. The unit does have a little trouble finding your destination sometimes. It will get you very close, but is sometimes confused in the last few hundred feet. This is particularly true for large parking lots, like around shopping malls. These are not apparently mapped into the program and the device will show you driving through vast nothingness as you travel through a large parking lot. Equally, on the return trip, the device will sometimes be confused by the parking lot. It once told me to "Drive .3 miles and make a U-turn" in a parking lot. What would be the point of that? However, once you've gotten yourself out of the parking lot and onto a road, it doesn't fail to lead you on your way. I'm very pleased with this purchase and recommend it without reservations for anyone looking for a reliable and reasonably priced GPS navigator.

review_title: Laura * It is fabulous*
review_text: I really love everything about it. I is so user friendly ! I took it out of the box and was able to use it with ease instantly. I used to Hate driving in un familiar territory, but now don't stress at all. It is so nice to be able to see what street is comming up before you can see the actual street sign. Also It directed me where to turn when the actual street signs were missing or obstructed ( a case where I surely would have gotten lost or made multiple turn arounds ) Being able to instantly see gas and food options around you is fantastic. Also could type in the name of businesses such as office depot, and it showed me all six near by. I highly recommend Garmin, it has made working with real estate so much easier.

review_score: 2
review_title: More flash than substance
review_text: This is the 3rd GPS unit I have owned and I am a bit disappointed. First off, the "intergrated traffic monitoring" means that the unit is shipped with Garmins add-on GTM12 device. This device is not integrated and needs to be attached to the 370 for operation. The Bluetooth integration is useful, but the volume and quality of the built-in speaker is not great, making it difficult to hear callers. The units detour feature is also more limited than other units I have owned. For instance it does not allow the user to view the chosen route and exclude a road. You are only able to exclude the road that you are currently driving on.Other than that, the maps are fairly up to date, POI database has a lot of information and the screen is pretty decent in most light.Finally, like most other units I have used, it does have a tendancy to pick routes that are not optimal. For example it may route you through the middle of a city because it is the shortest distance (mileage wise)to a destination. This fails to take into account the multiple traffic lights and inherent congestion and can add a huge amount of time to a trip that could have been much quicker if another route had been chosen.If you must have a Nuvi, save your money and buy a 350...the added features of the 370 are not worth the added cost.

review_title: Outstanding
review_text: We reviewed several GPSs before buying the nuvi 350 and have been very pleased. Good sensitivity, small size, good display, intuitive programing are the high points. The speach is a little hard to understand but there are several voices to pick from. Australian Karen seems to be the best for a lot of people. Suction mount works great and becomes permanent if left on the windshield. Others find it comes loose in the summer. In my SUV it works fine just setting in the cup holder. Another advantage is that it can be used outside the car and there is a lot of online support for Garmin features.

review_text: I bought this little beauty to use in my car that doesn't have a nav system as well as on my motorcycle. I have used it locally in the Denver area a few times, but it really shows its stuff on road trips. The mp3 player is great, the enunciation of streets and roads is super and the database of restaurants, parks, etc. is on a par with the $2000 built in system in my wife's car. The one thing I wish maybe that I had gotten is to buy the Nuvi 360 which has blue tooth, but I'm extremely pleased with the 350.

review_title: User-friendly, should of gotten one w/bigger screen
review_text: This unit is not that bad. I decided to get the 350 because of its high ratings on another website. Most of the people that did buy this were first-time owners of navigation systems. The user-interface is easy to operate, and maps/points are somewhat up to date, with the few exceptions of some known restaurants in my area that I've known to have at least been closed-down for almost a year now. Another cool feature about this unit is the choice of accent/language of voice navigation. The only time I had an issue was when I powered-up without first flipping-up the antenna. For some reason, it took more than 3 minutes to acquire satellites. That day, as I remember, also happen to be rain-cloud overcast. I've heard that foul weather can also affect for the unit to connect to an overhead satellite. Overall, the unit is great to operate, user-friendly interface, my only regrets is that I should of gotten one with a bigger, wider screen. That makes a whole lot difference.

review_text: When I purchased this product, I did not know you had to buy map updates. I downloaded all items that were free from[...]. However, the GPS often makes mistakes and I do not understand this. In certain areas, it does not work. It boggles my mind when I put in a Hospital for instance and it takes me to an empty field. Or, it takes me past the address I want. I am confused and perplexed. Am I supposed to buy map updates? There was no manual, so I do not know. Can anyone help me understand? [...] Thanks, Sam

review_title: BEST ONE OUT THERE
review_text: After weeks of changing my mind between the Garmin 2720 and the Nuvi I finally decided on the Nuvi because of its compact size, window mount, and extra features. I received it yesterday and this thing is nothing short of amazing. It aquires satellites within 10-30 seconds and is ready to go. Navigating is easy with the full touch screen and the 3D view is incredible. Before purchasing this product I had been using the original Streetpilot III Color Map which for anyone familiar with this has practically no navigation capabilities. The Nuvi is like a breath of fresh air for me. Now I can just select the place I want to go (either pre-entered or on the fly) and it takes me there. I travel a lot - both by plane and car and this will be very easy to take with me on a plane trip and then use in a rental car. Not to mention while on the plane I have an MP3 or I can download an audio book. I also really like the windshield mount - the DC charger plugs into the mount not the GPS unit so all you have to do is place the GPS in the mount and its powered - No fumbling with cords.This thing does it all and I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to anyone looking to upgrade or downsize!

review_title: My Garmin 350
review_text: I have had this GPS system for almost a month and am very satisfied with it. The main reason for getting a GPS system it does very well, getting you to a place you have no idea how to get to and back. That is the only reason I wanted one. If you are lost hit home and it will get you home, think if this was your son or daughter lost someplace, it sure beats asking a stranger in a strange place for help.Set up is extremely easy, finds satellites quickly, using the TTS voices it will speak street names and give turning prompts well in advance of the turns clearly. I don't really care for the MP3 playing capability but I have it, I don't care about the audio book feature but I have it. I care about getting from point A to point B and back, and that is why I got it. You will not be sorry purchasing this system, the compact size it great and the brightness and view-ability is excellent.

review_title: Love it!
review_text: As a former Magellan owner, I didn't know what to expect when we got our Nuvi 650. The unit is small, and doesn't obstruct from the windshield view (a problem the Magellan had due to its bulk). The package we got included the suction cup windshield mount, a leather case and the various cords and whatnot.You can use it without plugging it in (provided the battery is charged, of course!) and to date it's not steered me wrong yet. We sometimes change the voice (it comes with a bunch of them to choose from, both male and female of various accents). It offers TTS on most of the voices which is important to me. My daughter dances competitively and so I am constantly driving her to competitions out of state, not once has the Garmin let us down.When we first got it, I ran both units side by side for a couple trips and the Garmin does not always give the same directions as the Magellan -- but the Garmin's directions were usually quicker. Another thing I noticed was that the Garmin does not get lost in downtown areas (the Magellan could never seem to acquire satellite signals in any big downtown area).Well worth the cost and when I eventually need to replace it, I'm going with another Garmin!

review_text: On my short list of things "worth every penny" the Nuvi is a prominent player. My wife and I moved to Seattle last year and should have bought this long ago. It has freed us from feeling confined to only the areas we're familar with. We love demoing it to friends, who turn around and buy one soon thereafter.It's not perfect - technology rarely is - but it's well above average. This is a wonderfully designed product and I highly recommend it!!!

review_title: Supperior GPS unit
review_text: I recently purchased the C340 for myself after borrowing a unit made by Magellan. I became instantly frustrated by the Magellan from the moment I powered it on. It took me quite some time to figure out how to enter in my destination from the get go. While nearing my destination, the unit was preparing to tell me to turn left at the next street. I proceeded to turn and found out it was off by about 200 ft. When the route attempted to recalculate the route, it took no less than 30 seconds before it got me on my way. After my business meeting, I wanted to get back home. This feature was not availabe on the Magellan. Now that I have the Garmin C340, I have found all of these issues have been resolved along with the talking street name feature which works great. This is the best unit I have ever played around with and the best $150 I have ever spent.

review_title: Works for me
review_text: I got this after reading a number of reviews on different GPSs and it seemed to best meet my needs. I needed a GPS for work because I go to different homes in my city 1-2 times per week. Before I'd look up maps on Google map and print them out. Sometimes I'd find out en route that I actually need to go somewhere else which could be tricky. My thoughts about this one (which is the only one I've ever owned):Pros:--Easy to use and set up (and I'm not very savvy for non-computer based tech devices).--Seems to have up to date maps, at least for my area. Yesterday a client told me that their street had just recently been named and it was on the map.Cons:--Does not usually choose most efficient cross-town directions. I usually ignore these, make up my own route to get the general area and then use the GPS for getting around the neighborhood and finding a specific house.--Does not seem to factor in stop lights at all and always underestimates time of arrival for in-town driving. (I'm told it overestimates for highway driving but I haven't done that yet.) This is a pretty significant consideration for me... Google maps has been amazingly accurate at timing. Since I'm fitting in this driving to try to arrive at a certain time between other scheduled appointments it is helpful to have a fairly accurate time estimate. Now I know to add 5-10 mins to all time estimates on the GPS. I think this might be why it messes up the cross-town routes, too, since it doesn't seem to know that it takes longer to go on surface streets than to take the highway. Not a big deal now that I know, but I do still use Google maps for planning my day when I'm going to an unfamiliar area. Now I no longer need to print out maps, though, which is nice.Overall, this GPS meets my needs for providing mostly accurate (street numbers are occasionally off by one house but street location and general area of street numbers are correct) and easy-to-use directions within neighborhoods in my town. It's been wonderful for the times when there's a change in location when I'm already on the road.

review_title: REALLY F-U-N helper!
review_text: How wonderful is a device that lets you type in your destination very easily, then talks you all the way to the front door? Or one that has an inexhaustible list of grocery stores, service stations, hospitals, parks, theaters, etc., and will talk you right to their doors in any town in North America? Easy to use, and it picks up satellites quickly anywhere in the car; I usually leave mine on the center console and don't bother to stick in on the windshield. When you arrive, snap it off the power cord, put it in its leather case, and drop it in your pocket. No problems with theft, and its battery lets you walk about anywhere for 3 - 4 hours using it as needed if you want to leave it on. GREAT little helper; I take it everywhere. Now this male doesn't have to ask directions ^|^

review_title: Nuvi 650 stripped down from the 660 packaging
review_text: I have have a been a long time Garmin GPS customer including three generations of the Streetpilot. I am very pleased with the Nuvi 650 echoing some of the praises you've read here in the reviews.However for those of who are on the fence about getting the 650 versus the 660 for the extra Bluetooth, FM transmitter and traffic receiver, I want to offer you some more reasons to consider the 660. The Nuvi 650 does not include the leather carrying case, AC adapter and printed manual which comes standard with the 660 packaging ($50 value).As a an old time Garmin user, I am used to having these items come with my GPS. In addition, the Nuvis do not include CD/DVD map software nor the friction mount (must buy separately esp. for California and Minnesota). Considering how easy it is now for users to access the memory space of the Nuvi from their computers, it's much easier to corrupt the system unintentially. Thats when you'll need the original map software to recover.Don't get me wrong, I do like the Nuvi 650 over my Streetpilot 2720 for it's size, improve user interface and the SirF Star III receiver for much more reliable GPS reception. But I can only give this product 4 stars because of the lack of accessories that I find essential for my usage and yet comes standard for the Nuvi 660, 670 and 680.

review_title: Garnin c340 GPS unit
review_text: Wish I had bought it sooner. We have left the house and over a hundred miles turner into a drive we had not been to before. Its text to speech feature is great when in heavy trafic or multiple steets from an off ramp. That feature is well worth the extra it costs over the c330 unit. I have had the unit fall off the windshield with the mount because it was not mounted securely. My fault. I ended up shuting it off and after stopping I just selected my destination again and continued on after it aligned it self. Great unit.

review_title: You will not get lost BUT...
review_text: &iexcl;Kbut you have to update it at LEAST every 2 years (every year is perfect if you can afford it, around $200), if a business or location was established the same year you bought the Garmin, sometimes even the year before, it might not come up. This is okay though because you can just put in another place close to it, and you get there. Only happened once, the Garmin is still very worth it. I just got it though for my boyfriend and he loves it so much he even gave it a name and talks to it sometimes&iexcl;Kmen. Being new to Chicago I use it and I NEVER get lost. I love it. First time to use one of these and I do not think I could live with out it!!

review_title: NOT RELIABLE
review_text: I bought my Magellan for $1,000 about 2 years ago. In the last two years, it has frozen up on me twice! The first time I sent it in for repair, it was free, as I had not yet had the unit for a year. I had to call customer service again today (yes, in India), and found out it would be $150 to repair! My boyfriend has the same Magellan, and his sound recently stopped working (also had it for about 2 years). Rather than having to pay repair fees for what seems like every 8 months, I just bought a Garmin today for $250 more! The Magellan 700 was a COMPLETE WAIST of $1,000.

At one point we felt that it was taking us off the beaten path but realized at the end of the day this would not have happened as the route it would have chosen would have been a better one.The only place it was a little confused was a gravel secondary highway with sharp turns.Thanks for the great product and we will never travel without it.Megan MacCormack

review_title: Problem with this is Magellan and Amazon !!
review_text: Magellan is a company that thinks it can do no wrong.It is a french company.(No Wonder).They tried to get me to pay for a software update,only days after I got the thing.They are telling me that it will upgrade my unit to a 760.I told them I did not want the 760,bought the 700.They told me no update without a hundred dollars.My problem is I just got the thing out of the package and it needs software update already.What are you selling obsolete items.they say no,but you need the update anyway.but I just bought it.So,they don't care.They are trying to sell the units that they have sitting in backstock as new items.And adjust the price as they go.This company really is terrible.I am going to use this thing as much as I can until it breaks.I will never buy another thing from these french Fu%&$ again.I told them that.they don't care.they need to be taught a lesson.Remember WWII.Don't buy this product.You'll be sorry if you do.Shame on you if you buy this thing.If you do,don't say you weren't warned. Also shame on Amazon for carrying their products.There were plenty of reviews that told of this.Don't they read their own customers reviews??

review_title: It simply works, better than most other GPS out there
review_text: I have been a long time user of various GPS systems for over 8 years now.I started with the Hertz Neverlost 1st generation all the way to the 3rd generation (made by Magellan).I bought the C320 a year ago after a lot of research, time spent on GPS forums online.I bought a Magellan Roadmate 300 and 850 to compare to the C320 on a road trip from Arizona to Vegas.Both seemed to perform fine, although Magellan software is less intuitive to use and required extra clicks to do the same thing.On the way back from Vegas to Arizona, there was a major accident and the highway was closed. The Magellan GPS gave an alternate route of going through Flagstaff, which was going to add 2 hours to the trip.The Garmin GPS gave an alternate route of going through Williams, which only added an hour to the trip. The Garmin GPS had much better route detail and accuracy.I returned the Magellan units after the trip due to the dismal performance.My friends also purchased the Mio C310x GPS units recently. While they like the Mio C310x, it does not compare to the C320 as a GPS unit. The Garmin C320 is simply so much easier to use, due to the extremely intuitive menu system. The Mio C310x interface is very disorganized and confusing. Not good for someone who is driving and trying to interact with the GPS.Pros:-extremely intutitive menu system makes it a no-brainer to use-very accurate routes-GPS performance is great, WAAS system helps accurate pin-point of location (lack of SiRF chip is no concern here - it works better than the Mio which is SiRF enabled)-the battery lasts a very long time. Most of the time I do not use the car charger at all-SD card based, so no hard drive failure to worry about-menu performance is fastCons:-no mp3 player (not a big deal, I use my 40 GB iPod on road trips anyway)-no bluetooth (I listen to radio for traffic anyway during rush hour)-a bit bulkier than the sleeker nuvi units (but I have a cup holder that fits the GPS unit fine)Overall I HIGHLY recommend this GPS unit if you are looking for an affordable and yet highly usable GPS system.

review_title: Garmin is great!
review_text: We purchased two Garmin nuvi 350's for Christmas gifts. Both are working great. I did have an issue when nuvi tried to take me over the collapsed Interstate 35 Bridge in Minneapolis (collapsed August 1st won't be rebuilt until next year) but when I took one of the two roads I could off the ramp it did route me to the address which was great. Sometimes I'll put in an address when I leave home and it will try to take me a route that isn't quite regular but when I go the route I know it corrects itself. Maybe the route it designates is better but I haven't tried that yet. Overall, a great tool and wonderful help in finding locations quickly.

review_title: VERY SATISFIED
review_text: ********First things first, i must say that this is the only GPS unit i have used so i have no point of reference*****************I bought this in September of 2007*********I first to decided buy a GPS unit because of my new job. I am a college admissions counselor and during my first travel season, i was required to visit over 80 high schools and about 15 college fairs. After doing some research (mostly on cnet, amazon, and circuit city), I decided to go with the C330 because of expert reviews, user reviews, cost, and the features.I must say, this unit made my job SO EASY.I was able to easily find all but two locations without any problems. The high schools and colleges were already programmed into the GPS so i didnt even have to worry about typing in addresses. The ones I was not able find are diffucult to find anyway, according to people i spoke with. My job does include some downtime but i was able to find movie theaters, golf courses, restaurants, malls, and much more, with no problems. I was also easily able to figure out how long it would take for me to get to my next destination. This unit also allows for me to type in a specific location and then easily look for different points of interest in that area.Initially, my girlfriend thought i was wasting my money. She didnt see the need for the unit. That soon changed when i showed her all it could do. SHe has relied on it on many occasions to get to places. She is not the most tech savvy person but was able to use the C330 with no problems. She now loves having the GPS around and has no complaints.With all that being said, there are a few cons about this unit, including;*The maps are not the most up to date but are still fairly new.*Sometimes the routes chosen by the unit are not the most efficient but not a major issue, i never had any problems getting to my destinations and was never late to scheduled appointments and events*The unit does take a few minutes to warm up (find current location of GPS)THe pros of this GPS definitely outweigh the cons. I was looking at many entry level GPS systems and am glad i bought this one. If and when i do finally decided to upgrade, it will be another Garmin for me.

review_title: Great unit. So easy to use, even my wife can figure it out.
review_text: After using the GPS navigation system that came with my car, my wife decides she wants one also. So knowing my wife and after doing some research we decided on the Garmin StreetPilot c320. We got it for the price, size, features, and I have a Garmin eTrex Legend so I'm very familiar with that brand. We chose the c320 over the c330 because of the $100+ price difference and especially because you get the freedom of loading in only the states/provinces you need. Also since you load the maps using the CD, you can every easily load updated maps using any future updated CD's. I don't know how you would do it when the maps are stored in the internal hard drive like the c330. Also it takes a lot less power to read off of the SD card than a hard drive so the battery will last longer per charge. The unit came with just a 128 mb card and that wasn't enough for us as we travel up to Canada quite often and we live in the NJ just outside of the NY metro area so just by having those two state in the memory card, that doesn't leave much room for much more and that just won't work for us because we ski in the New England states all the way up to Maine and we go to Florida quite often so we'll need maps for those areas. So I got a 512 mb card [...] and I was able to get all the states on the east coast plus Vermont, Hew Hampshire and Ontario Canada including Hamilton and Toronto. So after the setup I compared it with the GPS navigation system that came with my 2005 Honda Accord with the latest DVD mapping software. I found that for the most part they were identical. They both took me through the same route with some minor variations. What I liked about the Garmin is that when you get closer to the next turn it will zoom in closer for greater details of the streets. Then after the turn it will zoom back out to get a greater view. Another thing I like about the Garmin is that it seems to have more Points of Interests (POI) than my car's system. For example, I belong to a Tennis and Fitness club. I don't know the address but knew the name of the club. With the Garmin I was able to search for it using the different categories under Athletic Clubs. The club wasn't even in my car's navigation data base. The only thing I wish the Garmin can do that my car's navigation does is show you the list of turns and roads it plans to take you and the distance away your destination is from your current location. My wife is learning to deal with the mounting location of the unit but wishes that the mounting arm can be smaller so she can mount it on the dash of her car and not take up so much space. Overall she absolutely loves it and uses it all the time. Oh, one other thing that needs improvement is the "Go Home" feature. In my car's navigation system when you store your home location, in order to use it you have to punch in a 4 digit PIN. This way if someone steals your car, they won't be able find where you live. With the Garmin it doesn't have that safety feature. So if the unit gets stolen and you've put your home address in there, they'll know where you live. Therefore, to combat that security concern, I put the address of a nearby strip mall instead of my actual address. This way it will get us to a place where we are familiar with and get home from there.

review_title: I prefer the Garmin C320 over Garmin C330 and Garmin i3
review_text: We bought this unit and the Garmin i3 for comparison since they are about the same price. I was initially interested in the i3 because it's smaller in size. It's much easier for traveling, especially going to Europe, we are thinking of carrying it while we are walking. But once we compared it with the Garmin C320, we returned the i3. Using the wheel on the i3 is tedious compared to touch screen feature on the C320. It is definitely easier to see the bigger screen while you are driving. And I do think it's worth buying the dash mount because it's a pain to keep pulling the suction cup on and off the windshield leaving circular marks on the windshield. The dash mount does not require adhesive, it just sits there. It works very well.Another comment I want to add is that it is very easy to load maps onto the unit. I live in Calif and if I am in town, there is no point in holding the whole country's map on this unit. The more states, cities you have in your database, the longer it takes you to scroll through to find the state, city, street that you are looking for. When I travel out of state, I just load the other state(s) onto the unit prior to leaving home. That's why there's really no need to buy a 1G memory chip and load everything on there. And that's the reason why I decided not to buy the C330 which has USA and Canada and Puerto Rico on it. Plus the price is another $100 higher

review_title: Practical technology
review_text: I am in the middle of a 4000 mile road trip - the first using a GPS device of any sort. The Garmin has performed to perfection. I have discovered that I prefer to use "view map" on those long interstate miles where there are no turns for the next umpteen miles - then entering specifics when I get close to stopping for food, gas or lodging. I have also discovered that by using the (-) key in the upper left that I get earlier warning to turns - which is nice when traveling at interstate speeds. It can be a pain for those states (like California) that don't allow mounting on the windshield - to find a better way to keep the GPS where you can use it. Not a complaint against this particular GPS - it true of all. The POI's seem to be adequate - though I could wish that rest stops on the interstates were marked. However, I think this is minor when compared to the useability overall.Well, I have now completed the 4000+ mile trip. When I first wrote we hadn't been in the little mountain roads of New Mexico or Colorado. I'm more impressed now. Even in canyons with high sides the GPS didn't lose lock but once or twice - and then recovered quickly when the sides opened up. We even found a cafe in a most out of the way location you can imagine - and really enjoyed the food in this little 'mom and pop' operation. The 'recent locations' is a great utility. No matter where we strayed off to, just simply going to recent locations and choosing the address of our motel or hotel brought us right back without a hitch. It even recognized when there were service roads beside the main street and directed our turns into food, gas and lodging at the right place then along the service road to the location. We really had a good experience.For an easy to use, practical GPS without all those bells and whistles - this is a great choice.

review_text: This product is great, easy to read direction, even tells you when you should make turns. It pretty accurate, but it's a little dated. The 700 doesn't give u a zip code option which is very handing. I say get the 760, or the 800 for an extra 100-200, it's worth it, because it newer cooler and more options. But if you're saving up or not willing to spend that much, the 700 is a great option for you.

review_title: not good
review_text: I bought this from RadioShack when going out of state because I was tired of getting lost and I paid around $550. This was maybe 5 years ago and It was not worth it. Now you can buy a better GPS like Garmin(if your in USA) for less than $100. This GPS has lots of bugs and sometimes makes you drive around in circles for no reason and will not re-route to the correct location. The map updates are very expensive, around $50-$100. You can get free lifetime updates nowadays from Garmin. This model is probably worth like $60 now. Dont pay $450, thats insane. You would throw away your money.

review_title: Very Content with Navigon 7100
review_text: It is my opinion that Navigon offers a more superior product and feature set than any other unit within this price range. I read complaints from others about touch screen sensitivity and I did experience a little bit of this myself until I found an option to do a touch screen calibration. It helps but doesn't totally fix the issue. I believe Navigon is a company that is sincere in its wishes to keep their units as up to date as possible and will fix any bugs we make them aware of.I was traveling on Interstate 95 this morning and observed Reality View for the first time. All I can say is "impressive". The view was almost exactly as the highway signage was in real live. I hope Navigon continues to expand the number of highway exits that have this feature. Satellite acquisition for me is very fast...like within 10 seconds of power up I have a working map. I am extremely happy with my 7100 and can look past any of the tiny things that are considered annoyances. No unit is perfect for every person.

review_title: Calculates route quickly and accurately
review_text: I've used other GPS's in the past, and they are slow, always lose satellite reception, and bring you in a roundabout route. This Garmin Nuvi 350 is just the opposite -- fast, hardly ever loses reception, and brings you in a direct route. If you get miss a turn, it also recalculates quickly.It is missing some of those features that the other Nuvi's have, but I feel like those are not necessary. You're buying a GPS, not a bluetooth phone. This is the best GPS for its price, I think!One thing that could be improved is the database of restaurants, parks, supermarkets, etc. The feature for finding the nearest restaurant or supermarket is useful, but only if the database is complete. I find that sometimes something as well-known as "Wholefoods" is not in there.All in all, it's a good GPS. Never get lost again, and go to places spontaneously (instead of printing google maps first)!

It only tells how far the next turn is but not telling the name of the street. It takes a while to get used to it. I still peek on the screen to see the street name before I turn.3.

review_text: This product works as advertised. The maps are easy to read and understand. Being an original Streets and trips user I miss the over view and the ability to zoom out features. But it compact size, auto re-routing for incorrect turns features makes it a great asset. Its vocal commands are a little hazy especially with street names that are unique or abnormal. Other then that is is an excellent tool and I am happy with this purchase.

review_title: Well designed and good support
review_text: When I first got the unit, both the application and maps were outdated. I was able to use TomTomHome to update the application to the latest version, but the maps update is nowhere to be found on the web site. I called TomTom Support 866-486-6866. Within reasonable wait time, I was able to talk to a support tech. After verifying the receipt, he added the US map update to my TomTom account without charge. TomTom guarantees the latest map after purchase. The updated map is more accurate than the Magellan 4000 that I purchased just three months ago.I am also enjoying the free real time traffic update right now. But for silly reasons, the free service expires every three months and I need to request reactivations. The traffic data is much better than any free traffic data that you can get from Google or other sources. You do need to have a cell phone with wireless data service and bluetooth to communicate with the server.I like the fact that there are tons of storage on the 20GB internal drive. I can add more voices, color schemes, and custom POIs. There are many free POIs on the Internet. TomTom's built-in POIs are pretty complete to begin with.You have the option to turn on Text-to-speech for voice turn-by-turn prompt. Some people may feel that it may be a little too wordy. I prefer the use of special tones rather than an English sentence at the turning points.The unit is not slim or easily pocketable. But the battery seems to last a long time even with screen on. There are battery saving options that will automatically turn off the screen between turns and turn off the unit entirely when your turn off the car.Overall, I found it very satisfactory as the map and POIs are complete and the unit is easy to operate. These are the most important things for a GPS.

review_title: Excellent unit ....... almost
review_text: Got this unit 4 months ago. Has been a great help since I relocated to a new state.Pros -1. Quite accurate maps.2. Voice prompts with street names3. Good battery life.Cons -1. Voice prompts too close before the turn. If u r not paying attention reading the screen, the voice prompt might come a little too late if u r not in the correct lane to make the turn.2. Some addresses not recognized.... although it does recognize the street names when I show up there. Happened only once though.Overall, a great unit for the price.

review_title: Our first GPS
review_text: The screen is great, and the vocals are surprisingly good (I was expecting to hear directions from Stephen Hawking). After a few test runs that always favored surface streets over freeways, I poked around in the not-terribly-complicated (but without much of an owner's manual, still a bit obtuse) menus and finally switched from the default shortest-route option to fastest-route. The screen is visible in all light conditions. We have bluetooth in the car, so we didn't need that. The sound quality is fine for the voice, but nothing like high-fidelity, not to mention that without a memory card, you won't get very many mp3's on there. All in all, we're happy with the 650.

review_text: The GO910 is awesome right out of the box it basicaly did everything on it's own. Our only problem came when we tried to link it to TomTom Home the online site. It took over an hour with their customer support and about half an hour on hold to get it to recognize the device. Since then, we haven't been able to make it work on our own. We read all the reviews on Amazon before we bought the item and have no regrets about it. We live in Germany so we were very interested in the built in European maps. Guess what, they work great! It's worth the money. Their tech support could be better, but all in all it's great.

review_title: Great GPS
review_text: We love this GPS it is so small and slim. It has a ton of features and is 95% accurate on locations and directions. We have had only 2 occasions where the GPS has not shown proper coordinates and that was because the roads are new. My husband emailed the company and they said they would add the roads in their next software update. All in all a great little GPS - we bought one for my mother for her birthday and she loves hers too.

review_title: Great little unit
review_text: We've only used this GPS a few times, but it is so easy to use and very accurate. The screen is clear and easy to see and hear. Plugs into cigarette lighter, wall or runs off battery. You can even find restaurants and stores. My husband wasn't sure he would need it (typical guy thing), but it is truly a time and aggravation saver. I would highly recommend the Garmin Streetpilot.

review_title: Garmin Nuvi 350 - Superior GPS
review_text: Although I am new to the world of GPS, I conducted extensive research before making my decision to purchase the Nuvi 350. I read all sorts of reviews, specifications and comments.The rave reviews you see are all true. This thing is really magic. It locks in a signal very quickly and gives very accurate turn-by-turn directions. There really is no need to look at the unit while driving. It tells you everything you need to know. I just upgraded the firmware to the latest version 2.7 via the Garmin website and the mapping is very accurate. I really like the quick access to various points of interest - restaurants, airports, post offices, shops...you name it! Just pop it in and you are on your way.I had no idea there were all the extra features! I though I was buying a GPS and I got a fully functional portable entertainment system in the process. I do recommend headphones or a link to your car radio as the speaker is OK for directions, but not for listening to MP3s.I am looking forward to getting my GTM11 traffic receiver. If that works as well as the GPS, I will be totally thrilled about my investment. It does seem to be a lot to spend but so far, it has been worth it.Of all the negative things I read about this unit, there is only one that I agree with - the Lithium-Ion battery is inaccessible for changing by the owner of the unit. It is supposed to last around 1,000 hours but what I am to do once it goes out? The accompanying carrying case could also be improved with a secure belt clip.All in all, I highly recommended this purchase if you are looking for a simple and very portable GPS device. It also has pedestrian navigation function built into it which will come in very handy in big cities although I have had a chance to test that yet.

review_title: Disappointing to say the least
review_text: I was excited to get this GPS, as I attended the CES Show (Consumer Electronic Show) which it was awared "Most Innovative in GPS category. Well, I got one for myself and the one star is for the User Interface, pretty cool, and it looks pretty sleek. Here's what doesn't work:1. Monut, forget it. It's useless and will break with the first 10 uses.2. Volume, ok if you plan on never putting music on or windows open3. Stability, if you drive an SUV like I do, it doesn't handle a little bit ok shaking too well and resets4. Resetting, when it does reset it takes a good 7 minutes to figure out where you are on the GPS5. Maps, I live in San Francisco...it doesn't seem to recognize the following: Franklin, Market and 3rd street (so far...which is not a good start). Took it to Vegas, same thing, terrile recognition of roads, tried it in Irvine - don't bother6. Traffic - well pretty useless because if figures out traffic is slow somewhere but only know to re-route you to the next route (without verifying if traffic is really slow there too). So, again, a little pointless.

review_title: Traffic jam
review_text: I really like my Garmin. I personally wanted a GPS system that was small and compact. The screen is smaller than other models but I did not have a problem seeing the menu icons. It comes with a carrying case and the window mount easily comes off which is important against theft. The menu icons are easy to see and follow. I love how it tells you the street names before you approach them. The only problem I have with it is that the traffic feature sometimes loses reception and therefore doesn't work. Also, traffic does not appear on the normal map screen. It's a separate map you have to go through the menu to find. Otherwise, it's a great product.

review_title: tomtom failed so did Best Buy
review_text: This unit failed miserably on the first try out...We live in Henderson, NV, just outside las Vegas...our first itinerary was to Bolder City center about 15 miles away...the itinerary was supposed to take us from hwy 95 to hwy 93, but instead it directed us south on 95 towards Searchlight forty miles away...we of course stayed on the highway which becomes hwy 93...once we passed the instructed turn off, we expected to be warned of a route recalculation, but none came...as we approached Bolder City we were directed to make a right hand turn which I assume was to take us back to hwy 95...the right turn was into a trailer park...I took the unit back to Best Buy and ended up paying a 15% restocking fee which Best Buy is quick to tell you is explained on the back of your receipt...the receipt you received after you purchased the unit...I smell a class action suit coming and I will be first in line...By the way, the reason we did not get a recalculation warning is because the unit does not have automatic recalculation...how pathetic is that... Update to review...after an email complaint to Best buy, I was contacted by Best Buy and refunded the restock fee which I appreciate...regarding the moron comment, this was not my first GPS...I know the route recalculation command and did not receive one...when I returned it to Best Buy I was told that model did not have that feature...

review_title: Nuvi 650 lacks some important features.
review_text: It does not pick your preffered rout and insists on its pre programmed routs. It does not have what is known as bread crumbs. And for the most part you cannot just type the name of a business or an institution to find the directions. You have to know full address of your destination. eg I could not get directions to a well known hospital in the city by merely putting its name in. Ditto for a University in my city.I hear Tom Tom takes care of these problems. At times it tries to take you through a circuitous rout for apperent reason.

review_title: If only it worked.....
review_text: I bought this with high expectations, and from the referral of a friend. It was GREAT for the first 3 or 4 uses, but now, it's stuck on the first screen, and "locked up" so to speak. I was on my way to Poland and it literally would not work no matter what I did. Being in Germany, I HAVE to have something reliable, and especially on my way to a 3rd world country, driving alone, and not speaking their language. Therefore, unable to stop and ask for directions. Thankfully, I was close to a base and able to buy another GPS... one that worked. I am returning the TomTom and have already replaced it with the Navigon. It has yet to fail me. Maybe I got a dud, or maybe that is the extent of the TomTom quality. By the way, Polish pottery shopping was great, thanks to the Navigon!

review_title: Really bad product...
review_text: I bought this as my first GPS and really enjoyed the fact that I could figure out (yes, it is a little complicated to put in your address) how to put in my home address and that it got me home with the voice prompts. But over the month that I have owned this product I have found that it has several SEVERE!!!! limitations. So, to be fair, I will list out a few pros, to the X930Pros:1. Size - It is small and light weight which makes it easy to carry around.2. Price - Well... it is priced cheaper than other product. But to say that it is in the same class as the others??? Well, I dont know enough about other products to say that, and that is why its in the pros list.OK now thats all I can think of for the pros, now here are the cons and you have to realize that I am not comparing it to any other GPS. These are just things that I expect from a basic GPS and the X930 fails miserably at...Cons:1. The second day that I bought this unit, I could not figure out how to put in my office address on it. My office is on a US-Highway (RT-1 in NJ, to be exact) and there was no way that I could figure out how to put it in. I later called customer service and found out that it apparently have a "problem" with locating addresses on major US highways and that they would contact me about the next day about a solution after contacting their development center in FRANCE. Day 7 - No contact yet!!!2.It doesn't calculate directions unless you start driving and get on a road that it recognizes, which means, if you are in a parking lot and the unit doesnt recognize it as a major road, you have to get out and guess the direction you have to turn before it actually calculates where you have to go. A 50% chance that you get the first turn right (for me, i've gotten it right about 20% of the time), this is really bad, because depending on which road you get onto, it has to recalculate the directions and by the time, you might have made a wrong turn again.3. Speaking of route calculation, it is really slow for long distances, I tried it for a couple of trips that went over 300 miles and it took about 5 to 7 minutes to recalculate. I am assuming that the recalculation occurs from the point that it has picked up the signal, so in the 5-7 mins that it is recalculating, if you make a bad turn, it goes into the 5-7 mins recalculation cycle again and again and again. I finally resorted to stopping the car and waiting for it to calculate the route so that I could get to where I was going. Route calculation for shorter distances is reasonable.4. Maps are fairly outdated. I have been to places where the device does not recognize the road and keeps giving me the start driving prompt so that I get to a road that it does recognize. This is really frustrating since this is product that was released in 2006 (october I guess) and the road has been there long before that.5. ViaMichelin did not even have a US website until recently, and even there the support page (I went there hoping for some MAP/Firmware upgrades) only lists the un-helpful customer service number.Again, all these comments come from a person who has never used a GPS before. Maybe I have very high expectations from a GPS unit, but I would assume that these are basic expectations from a GPS unit.I would recommend that you stay away from this product.-- UPDATEI only have 1 thing to say about this GPS and to all of you who give this greater than 1 start.Try putting in an address on a local highway, for eg: route 1, route 22, route 21, etc (sure, it will show you the road when you get there, but it will not let you put it in as an address) and see if you can get this thing to recognize it. If you can, please respond to this post an tell me how you did it and I will change my rating.For me, the entire purpose of owning a GPS is to be able to put in an address and get there, doesnt have to be the prettiest or the easiest route, but it should at least accept the address that I am trying to punch in.I give it 1 start coz I can not give it 0. :(

review_title: Terrible GPS, even considering the cost
review_text: I absolutely CANNOT recommend this GPS considering all the name brand options in this price range. I purchased it based on the price and reviews and felt I had done well. I had no need for the extra bells and whistles that others come with, it was a better price. It had a poor interface, but I could suffer with that b/c of the price. It took awhile to acquire a signal, but I could suffer with that b/c of the price. Or so I thought. One time it took over 35 minutes to acquire signal. Another time my wife really needed it (she was driving to an unfamiliar area, at night, in the rain) and it never aquired a signal the whole 45 minute trip. Now I accept it won't stop the rain, can't turn the night into day, but I DID expect it to help her find her destination. She was scared and late for her appointment! I started wondering, , do I need to suffer with that b/c of the price? Well, I chose to call ViaMichelin to see if I might have a defective unit. The polite, helpful, customer service told me the ViaMichelins have a 'quirk'. If the unit was shut off for more than 8 hours, it would take awhile to re-acquire the signal. His suggestion was to power the unit on about a half hour before it was needed, so it would have time to find the satellites. I thought this was crazy, so I decided to return it and shop for another.I settled on the Magellan Maestro 3100. Again, based on price and reviews. This GPS has an interface that is a thousand times more user friendly, has that predictive text thing that makes data entry so much more easy, has a million other features that are far superior to the ViaMichelin, and MOST OF ALL, it acquires the signal within a few minutes. Doesn't matter how long it's been off, if it's raining, or if there's thick cloud cover.The only advantages the ViaMichelin has over the Magellan Maestro 3100 is the fact that it shows estimated time to destination and it has updateable maps. These are too few advantages for my money...

review_title: Such a helpful gadget!
review_text: I got this from my parents this past Christmas and used it recently to go look at some possible wedding locations with my fiance. We had printed out some directions from Google, but we would have gotten lost if we hadn't had this thing with us. It was great! I set it so that it has a guy speaking with an Australian accent and it warns you about 3 times before you need to turn or keep left/right. The screen is plenty big and I didn't have any problems putting things in. You also don't always have to finish inputting the street name or city because it usually knows which one you are talking about before you're done and it gives you 3 or 4 to choose from based on what you put in. This is my first GPS and this one was definitely perfect for my needs.P.S. The navigation systems aren't perfect by any means and any GPS is going to have a few "mistakes" about where it wants you to go. These may cost you a few minutes, but I think that the majority of the time these things are pretty accurate.

review_title: Will get you there but...
review_text: I got this to replace my GPS navigation software I used with my pocket PC. This unit is not nearly as advanced as what I had before. Sometimes it also does goofy routing through a residential area instead of a major road when clearly the major road is the quickest. In the end it gets you there but sometimes you get there in a less then optimal route. The menus are not intuitive. But because it does not have many options, that doesn't matter too much. The manual is poor in that it does not explain some of the screens. I also did not find a more detailed manual on the CD or online at their web site. Sometimes it take a long time to recalculate a route and recalculates over and over for a few minutes for no good reason. Fortunately it is not very frequent that it does that. Battery life after about 4 months using it is short, maybe 2 hours or 3 hours at the most. Now I usually just keep it plugged in all the time. It comes with a car and home charger.With that said it is pretty simple to use and not bad for the price. I got mine on sale online for about $140. For that price I can't really complain. It comes loaded with maps of all of the USA, Alaska and Hawaii in the 1GB SD card. GPS sensitivity is good and it gets a signal from about any place inside the car. The windshield mount is excellent. With a few small changes to the software this little unit could easily be a 4 star unit. But the limitations in the software makes me give it a 3 rating. The touch screen works fine but I would have preferred a QWERTY layout of the letters instead of the alphabetical layout for inputting addresses. At full price I would not recommend it. However, if you are looking for a basic unit, and find them on sale, it will get the job done without a very big bite out of your wallet.With the negatives

review_title: Wonderful GPS Unit
review_text: I placed this review on CNET as well, but thought it would be worth adding on Amazon too.I've read many reviews regarding the Garmin's, Tom-Tom's, Magellan, and other GPS units, and finally decided on the Garmin. This is a great unit and I am glad that I decided on this for my purchase.There are several key factors that make this a great product:1. Screen - Bright in broad daylight, big at 4.3", easy to use touchscreen2. Interface - Simple to use, especially for those who aren't tech savy3. Favorites - You can save your favorite addresses and name them in the system so you can plan routes from often used addresses over and over (I can't believe how many reviews I read that said Garmin didn't have this - they obviously didn't know how to use the unit).4. Points of interests - Lots of points of interest to look up as you travel along your route.5. Reroutes - Quickly reroutes you if you miss a turn or need to get around traffic - a matter of seconds.6. Satellite reception - Awesome - finds satellites in seconds and has great reception even in structures.7. Variety of map views - The 650 has both 2D and 3D map views, giving you a variety of ways of looking at your route. This is helpful in trip planning.8. Clear voice instructions - The route instructions are loud and easy to hear, even on the freeway.Cons:1. No zip code lookup - This is the one thing I wish Garmin would add to their nav system. Garmin has you input the state, then city, then address every time when inputting new addresses. It often finds the state, city, and address for you after a few letters, but it still would be much easier with a zip code feature. I think they may add this in the near future as most GPS systems do have this feature. It isn't a deal breaker, however, because of the overall performance of the system.Things you'll want to buy:1. Carrying case to protect the unit (Garmin makes one)2. A/C adapter if you want to charge it in a wall outlet (in my opinion, it isn't necessary, since it comes with both a car charger and a USB cord for charging it on your computer).3. Friction mount for the car if you don't want to use the suction cup mount (Garmin makes one).Updating the unit - Garmin offers a utility on their website for updating the unit's software. The latest updates were already on the unit, but it is nice to know that you can update it online.All in all its a great unit. If you are looking for Bluetooth and Traffic updates, then buy the 660, however, it does cost about $150 more currently.

review_title: Outstanding !
review_text: I love my new Garmin NUVI 350. Garmin has done a great job of making it easy to use, and it's small size makes it easy to install, yet the display is large enough to be useful. It quickly calcultes routes (in just a couple of seconds)and the voice prompts are truly helpful when driving in areas you are not familiar with. I just used it on a cross country trip and was amazed at how much easier travel was with food, fuel,rest area and hotel info immediately available at my fingertips. The 350 was also very useful when I was recently looking for real estate in an area that I knew little about....just type in the address and you are off!

review_title: Negative Time Investment
review_text: It seems futile adding a negative review amidst a thousand positive ones, but having suffered with this device for the past week, I feel a moral responsibility to do so.Context: I am a high tech professional of twenty-plus years. I have a nav system in my Acura as a point of reference. My unit came pre-installed with version 5.0 firmware. I purchased it at the outset of a ten-day multi-state trip to the east coast spanning New York (City), Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts. I did a great deal of both driving and walking during the trip, during which I consulted the unit the entire time, including long after I wanted to drop kick it.Here is a mere partial list of my complaints:* WebUpdater doesn't recognize my unit when I connect it to my Macbook. Possible that MissingSync is conflicting with it but I don't care to debug it.* Didn't work anywhere in Manhattan I frequented (mostly between 34th and 79th). It briefly acquired satellite contact twice but not long enough to provide any use.* Doesn't know alternate names of many roads. So it tells you to turn right on Jackson Street when what you see on the sign is Route 25.* Sometimes tells you "turn right in point one miles" when you're driving at 65mph. Effectively that means "turn right at the exit you just passed." It usually says "point two" but not always.* Makes odd suggestions at roundabouts. "Enter roundabout and take the second exit" apparently means "enter roundabout and exit at the second street you see." What it really should say is "enter and exit roundabout to keep proceeding east."* Thinks anything with "Lodge" in the name is a hotel. Not so when it's an apartment building with "Lodge" in the name. Major bummer when you're looking for a hotel in a remote location after midnight with two really cranky kids.* Doesn't get a signal through an under-insulated one-story cabin tin roof, even when the strength of the signal is full blast right outside the front door.* Doesn't let you pre-plot your next trip when you're in the midst of a current trip.* No way to "unstop" a stopped trip.* Inconsistent way to move back a screen. On some screens you press "Done", on most you press "Menu."* "Do you want to insert a Via Point here?" is a lame way to say "Do you want to plan a stop here?"* Robot voice is annoying and totally unnecessary.* Robotic voice is also confusing. When it says "turn right in point five miles" it sounds very close to "turn right eight point five miles." (Pronounce it both aloud in a robotic voice and you'll see what I mean.)Over the course of my trip I estimate that I spent four hours trying to help this thing help me. I'd be generous to say it saved me an hour.

review_text: The Tom Tom One XL was very easy to set up and use. The large screen was easy to see both at day and night. It worked well 99% of the time as far as accuracy. The only mistake so far was through a section of Boston's Big Dig. For the price and for those that don't want a complicated gadget, you just want simple and go- this is it.

The larger screen is really nice.

review_title: What a GPS ought to be
review_text: I've had 5 different GPS's over the years. Still using my $900 StreetPilot III from 6 years ago and LOVE it. I replaced my wife's GPS V this Christmas, and the C340 is exactly what a GPS ought to be. It doesn't connect with your phone. It doesn't show your photos. It doesn't play MP3 music. It just take you where you want to go. It's reliable. It's affordable. It runs -- if you want it to -- on its internal battery for hours after the power is shut off. It has the entire country and Canada preinstalled; no need to connect it to a computer for anything. It's really a steal. We like it so much, I bought two more for my father and brother-in-law. It is very hard to justify paying any more than this for almost anyone. It really disappoints me that it's discontinued by Garmin. It's perfect and people in the market should grab a couple while they are still around.

review_title: See ya later, Garmin
review_text: I called Navigon and they admitted that the 2G cards were a mistake from the manufacturer and it will be corrected. If you got a 2G card (check by hooking up the unit to your computer), then I suggest you give them a call. They claimed to have just found out themselves (maybe, maybe not!) and would contact me in a few days.As for the unit itself, I love it. It has a great display, viewable from many angles and in direct sunlight. It has all the features I wanted but never found in a single unit (bluetooth, free traffic reports, text-to-speech, voice recognition, multiple waypoints, route planning even if GPS isn't available, and the ability to select points directly from the map). It even comes with options that I didn't think I needed, but now I really like, such as Zagat reviews, branded POIs, stylus, lane assist, and reality view. The lane assist and reality view are nice when going through crazy interchanges in big cities. The screen could be a little more responsive, but I have thick fingers and have problems with other brands, too. Thankfully, Navigon did not waste their time with the extra junk that doesn't work well but seem to be the only selling points for other brands (music player, photo viewer, FM transmitter). I was skeptical of how well a stiff mount would fit in my car, but it swivels at one end at has a ball joint at the other, so you can easily position it in tight spaces. The GPS reception is good, even in downtown Philly and inside my apartment. The traffic warnings are helpful, but I don't always change my route because of them.Overall, this unit works great, the menus are intuitive, and it has tons of features. Not only that, but it looks dead sexy.

review_title: Fantastic Product!!
review_text: I purchased this item on Amazon after seeing it on one of the shopping networks. Saved over $30 and that's including express shipping. I have no desire or need for one of those other GPS units with various media players, I wanted just a basic unit that tells me where to go (no pun intended). Two days after I received it I went on vacation to a NASCAR race in Talladega, AL which is a 14-hour drive from where I live, and this unit got us there with no problems whatsoever. It refigured our route if we decided to go to a point of interest and we made excellent time. I was worried it might miss some of the backroads we were on, but no worries. Awesome. Highly recommend!

review_title: TomTom One XL
review_text: A basic GPS that serves its purposes. I have a built-in GPS in my car and bought this one for my Honda mini-van. I also travel a lot for work, so naturally, I use it in rental cars for work as well.What I like: I like the 3D view and the way the unit present the information to me. The unit provides very good directions; once I get used to the way it directs, I think I am better informed (or directed) thjan my built-in unit. Nice wider screen than my previous HP GPS PDA is definitely a big improvement. The voice level is more than adequate.What I don't like or want to see improved: There is no adjustment to the brightness of the screen. Although visible, I can use a little brighter screen under bright sun. The power plug is underneath the unit - I prefer it on the side, because the unit is so sensitive, I do not really need to mount it on the wind shield, I like to have the option of leaning it against the instrument panel; with the power plug underneath, I could not let it sit behind the steering wheel and lean on the panel. I still have not found a way to delete the favorite from the database, and there is no where in the manual can tell me what is the SD slot is used for. I plug in a blank SD card, the unit would not boot up until I remove it. Fully charged, the unit would last about 2 hours with the internal battery can be improved as well.Overall impression: A decent GPS unit that is well worth the money. Since I lost my HP GPS PDA (with all my personal info!!!), I am staying away from multifunction gadgets, this is one is highly recommended.

review_text: When I was making a decision to buy this navigation system I've read couple of negative reviews about this device and was almost discouraged. But when I got it - I realized the negative reviewers were just not bright enough to bend their dogamtic view of the routes. The system works like a clock, perfectly and dynamically reroutes. Even if it seems that it is suggesting something stranger than you'd expect - once you sit down with a map, you realize it does perfect job for the routing mode you've selected in the settings.Pros: Excellent graphics, slim, fast, strong signal, lifetime TRAFFIC,reality view, lane assist, quick rerouting, many othersCons: A little smaller graphical controls for my big hands, robotic voice, but still completely understandable.Conclusion: excellent buy for the price.

review_title: Odd occasional routing
review_text: I bought the Navigon after looking at several TomTom's, Garmin's, etc. I really liked the reality view and it certainly helps negotiate city interstate exchanges. The only negative I've found is it occasionally routes you in odd directions, one example had me turning south on an interstate near my house going to the next exit, doing a u-turn and heading back north. I could just entered the interstate going north in the first place. Overall, I really like the unit, however, pay attention for quirks in the turn-by-turn before starting your trip.

review_text: Comparing the tomtom1 3rd ed to the Garmin 330...In Indiana, my new tomtom is receiving signals from up 8 satellites. My new Garmin c330 often loses a connection, leaving a void in usefulness, similar to a cell phone dead zone. I returned the 330 for a replacement 330 after one week and the replacement is similar in connectivity. The 330 is only connecting to one satellite at a time.Operating as designed? Antenna Strength? Garmin? Who knows...Both units function well when receiving a signal.

review_title: What a deal
review_text: Great price. The GPS reception is amazing, I have a $600 Garmin that doesn't come close to this one, and that is without an external ant. The only short comming on the X-930 is the software navagation, It is a bit awkward! For example, you have to go through several screens to get to your saved addresses. To switch to night view is a royal pain, and sometimes I forget how to get to a setting and it takes a while to find it again. Oh and the map screen should let you remove the detail from the top to allow you to see more of the map. I was hopeing that they would come out with a software update, but on the website it looks like they have dropped this model from existance??? You might want to keep that in mind if you plan on buying a current model. Here today gone tomarrow.

review_title: For the money a lot of GPS
review_text: This is my 3rd GPS..the 1st was a C320 which I still have and also a NUVI 200 that was either stolen or lost...in any event I was looking to replace the NUVI 200.To be honest I was not impressed with any of the NUVI lines. I find the maps to contain way less information compared to the C line.This is my first TTS GPS and to be honest it took some getting used to as the voice is not as clear as the standard Turn Right in 500 feet voice...but after a day or so it is no problem at all. In fact you can turn off the TTS if you prefer the regular prompts.I had a real problem getting the Bluetooth to stay paired with my Blackberry Curve...doing some searching I was able to see that by upgrading the BT to the latest software on the GPS it stayed connectedMSN is pretty worthless other than a bell and whistle when it works...I won't be renewing it in a yearGreat GPS for the money as this was Top of the Line for Garmin before the NUVI came out..if you don't need the slim GPS get this one

review_title: The Right Choice
review_text: I had originally tried a Magellan GPS unit that required downloading of Canadian maps--to my Mac--it only worked with a PC. I returned it. I bought the Nuvi 350 on the advice of friends. It's Mac friendly, but required no downloads for Canada. I'm technically illiterate. I wasn't sure about assembly though it's very simple. I called for technical assistance. I got right through to a highly competent person who didn't bewilder me with his accent! I tried the Nuvi on recent trip. It took me where I was going beautifully. I'd buy the mount that sits on the dash rather than the windshield attachment that comes with it. It works perfectly, and you can get it out of sight easily so you don't signal the bad guys that you have a GPS unit in the car to steal.

review_text: This is a great device. If you have a job that makes you travel all the time, like I use to, I would grab it. If you have a job period, I would grab it.

review_text: We could not be more pleased with the StreetPilot. It has increased our confidence in driving-maps and directions were making us anxious.

review_title: easy to use
review_text: I used the GPS for the past month. I find Garmin Nuvi 350 very easy to use. The interface is intuitive. Moreover, it saves me a lot of time; I don't have to print directions from online services like mapquest. The GPS always guides me to the destination accurately. Furthermore, I find GPS is very useful when driving in poor weather conditions (such as heavy snows and rains) and one cannot see very far. I can see the road on the GPS and expect turns and intersections.

review_title: Battery life is a problem
review_text: I purchased a One XL not quite a year ago. With the exception of the battery, it's great!I use it several times a week and for the last couple of months, it's been hard to maintain a charge. It's at the point now where it won't power up at all and from what I've read, this unit has battery issues.I have no idea how pervasive battery issues are with this particular unit or TomTom in general but it seems to me that I've not used it more than average and for the battery to die after 9 months, is a problem. I am planning on purchasing a replacement battery but based on this expereince, I would hesitate to purcahse another TomTom unit.

review_title: Poor route routing
review_text: The 7100 does not calculate the shortest time route and takes you on round about routes. This has happened to me on more than one occasion while using the system on very familiar routes using different settings. When the unit was set for fast route which means fast roads not fastest time it took me on a route that was not the shortest time route. If you set it for shortest route it will provide a shortest distance route which may not be the shortest time route.I called Navigon and spoke to their technical support and general support people. They were unable to provide a solution to correct the problem.This was very disappointing since I know Navigon is a very good and respected supplier of GPS systems in Europe. To bad they did not wring out all the kinks before rolling this out in North America.Amazon is allowing me to return the item.

review_title: Wonderful tool for navigation
review_text: I was in a fix to either go for c340 or c330. Finally ended up with c330. The only two major differences are, c340 has text to speech and traffic ready option. Other than that, they are almost the same. The suction mount is very stable, the voice is very loud and clear. I agree with lot of other reviews about the non availability of good manual, but if you playaround with it, it should be fairly easy to figure out the functions and menus. About the Maps , I think the maps are pretty much up-to-date, considering the fact that there is no perfect map product.Overall, I rate it as an excellent buy and amazon.com price rocks!!!

review_text: Overall, it's a great unit. It gives good directions that are easy to follow. It knows both New York and Miami perfectly and gets us easily through scenarios where there are many hard and soft turn choices. Things to improve or think about when selecting:1. It doesn't have the traffic feature.2. The screen was a bit small for me. It couldn't always display the full name of exits on the freeway.3. The find by business name was overall very good, but a few businesses had closed and it didn't know them. Overall, it scored about 95%.

review_title: Works just as expected and as advertised
review_text: I had wanted to purchase a portable GPS ever since I had started using the Magellans installed in Hertz vehicles I rented on frequent business trips. However, after my daughter bought a Magellan 300 and had problems with satellite acquisition, I did some on-line research and in-store looking and decided on the Garmin c330. While I was aware of the problems experienced by some unlucky buyers, the vast majority of Garmin users seemed very positive about the unit. I can now join the majority. The unit is a breeze to use, is accurate and despite some attempts on my part to throw it off, it recalculated routes very quickly and set up new routes. My only criticism is that, as a resident of California, I cannot put the unit on the windshield and am hesitant to glue the dash-mount disk to my new car. I made a strap to fasten the unit to the steering column, and that seems to work just fine.

review_title: Nearly Flawless
review_text: I've used this GPS for a while and it does what it is supposed to do almost flawlessly. Just bought a second one as a gift for a niece. The display is large enough and the spoken directions come just when you need them. Minor quirks that I've come to expect and work around are short battery life so I keep it plugged in and a tendency sometimes to not accept a new location so I turn the unit off and on sometimes more than once. That said, this will become your most valued companion.

review_title: Instant Navigation
review_text: I got to give this unit a thorough workout this past week, and it performed flawlessly. It was simple to enter navigation points, and it computed the routing quickly. If we changed our routing manually, by taking a different turn, the unit quickly reconfigured a new routing and was back showing the way. I did notice the unit seemed to lag a bit when the roads were getting too close together on the map display. I have always thought highly of the Garmin product line as it has been around for many years in the aviation industry. We had a chance to compare performance with a competing product, name not mentioned here--but it is a common term for Native-American drums. The other unit was OK, but if we altered the route any at all, it persistently seemed to demand we do a "U-Turn" and get back on course. Also, the maps on the TT didn't seem to be as detailed as the Garmin product's. I got the delivery from Amazon in plenty of time for a Christmas gift, which was well received. Go for experience here!!

review_text: This GPS is so good that if you purchase one you can be confident it will do everything it says and easily. I have owned numerous handheld gps's for marine use but never had one for my car. This is so user friendly and works much better and easier than the ones that I have used in Friends autos that are built in and 10 times more expensive. The MSN direct works ok and you get it for free for the first twelve months to see if you like it and renewals are cheap. The display and voice directions are easy to understand and the bluetooth for your hands free phone is a nice bonus.

The unit is very accurate with turn by turn instructions and sounds a chime just before a turn. The AAA information is awsome for finding a starbucks a hospital or restauraunt while on the road that was the reason I purchased this unit and I was not dissapointed.

review_title: Picked Nuvi over the Roadmate 760
review_text: For those of you that are shopping around and not sure which GPS to get, go with the Garmin Nuvi 350. I brought it on a business trip and it paid for itself in one week. This was my first time travelling to Atlanta and with the Nuvi, it felt like I'd been there 10 times. First of all, the Nuvi is much smaller than the Roadmate so I could travel with it. I pre-programmed my destinations in as favorites before I left NY. All I did when I got down there was attach it to the windshield, select my location and listened to "Jill" guide me to my destination. I've recommended it to family and friends. Good luck with your decision!

review_title: Great Product (except for battery life and mount)
review_text: Compared to all the other GPS I've used (Magellan and Garmen), the Navigon is great for day-to-day navigating, route changes, bluetooth, traffic updates, etc....The only 2 negatives I've found:1) The battery only lasts 1- 1 1/2 hours before a full charge is needed.2) The mount for the windshield is terrible, this thing is so large - its cumbersome and must be taken off whenever you park your car - or your advertising from a distance away, you have a GPS unit....

review_title: So Good Someone Stole It...
review_text: I had this unit for about a month before it was stolen. Easy to use, got me where I needed to go and was great to find places to eat once I got there. The worst part was that the screen was a bit too reflective and hard to read when the sun was at certain angles. Also, certain street names were too long and couldn't be announced correctly. After it was stolen, I replaced it with the C530. It has a better screen and a security feature that prevents it from being used (if stolen). You do have to input a 4 digit number to enable it for your own use, but that's no problem. At least if this one gets stolen, noone will be able to use it without returning it to Garmin (who would contact me). The 530 doesn't announce street names, but I prefer the shorter announcements. Both units allow the use of POI (points of interest program that you can download from Garmin). This is great to get you near those geocaches before getting out your handheld for the hike in the woods. Both units are great, but I prefer the 530.

review_title: Garmin Nuvi vs. Garmin 2720
review_text: My wife travels to the homes of several new clients every week, so a GPS was the perfect gift for her. After much research, I chose the Garmin 2720 over the Magellan 760. But I didn't know about Garmin Nuvi until after I bought the 2720. I was torn after reading favorable reviews of the Nuvi, so I bought a Nuvi as well, with the understanding that we would test both and return one to the store.First of all, it is hard to go wrong with either, both are great products, and I got them both for about the same price.2720 Advantages:--Heavy duty construction. Waterproof.--Very sharp, bright screen that is more like a mini computer monitor.--Advanced GPS features.Nuvi Advantages:--Ultra compact, light, and portable. A brilliant design.--Reports of better receiver sensitivity.--Reports that it draws better routes.--extra non-GPS features: MP3, picture viewer, audio books, language translater.--can run on batteries and has a built in speaker2720 best suited for:--A motorcycle (it's waterproof)--Traveling salesmen that would enter many destinations and have the GPS choose the best route between all of them. The Nuvi can handle only 1 via point.--Mounted in a mini van/SUV for family vacations in rural areas. The 2720 gives you more control to plan your whole route. But the Nuvi would not be bad either.--The Techie who will use the advanced GPS features.Nuvi best suited for:--Your wife. I'm sorry, but a woman will choose the Nuvi over the 2720 almost every time. It fits easily in their purse.--Traveling by plane and using in a rental car. The Nuvi's ultra compact design makes this the obvious choice.--People who would use the MP3 player, picture viewer, other Non-GPS features.--People who travel in downtown areas, it will have fewer dropouts than the 2720.We chose the Nuvi. The 2720 was nice, but when my wife took one look at the Nuvi her mind was made up. She wouldn't use the advanced GPS features on the 2720, but she liked the MP3 player, etc. on the Nuvi. She loved the compact size, and the ability to run it on batteries in her car without the power cable. The screen is not as bright as the 2720, but it's still very readable.To see very detailed and technical reviews of all GPS receivers, see gpsinformation.netUPDATED December 2007:We've had this unit for almost two years now, and it still works great. In fact we bought a new Lexus with a built in Nav, and we still like the Nuvi better. It has better directions, an easier menu, and text to speech capability.One thing to note, the touch screen on the NUVI will not scratch easily. Many people are concerned that they need to buy a screen protector. This is not necessary. We've never used a screen protector, and I can't find any noticable scratches on the screen. And I can't count all the times that we've dropped it, or it fell off the dashboard. It still looks almost new.

review_title: Needs improvements
review_text: The unit is very basic. I only needed a basic gps so i purchased it. The price was really good. I was very disappointed when I used it. I took it to a trip and did it let me down. The initial directions were ridiculous. It took me of the highway and put me back on the highway several times. Then, when i reached the hotel, I took the directions for a mall (which has been there for 10 years)... The unit was off by 5 miles. It said you have arrived to your destination but I was pretty far away from my destination. The nice people at a gas station helped me get to the mall. On my way back, the gps just died. I checked the battery and it was dead. Th battery lasted less than 2 hours. I was extremely dissatisfied with the unit. Thanks to amazon.com's awesome return policy, I returned it.

review_title: Christmas came early
review_text: This is my first GPS device, having wanted one for a long time, but as I was close to getting the Magellan 760 (based upon reviews), this product came out. Having used it now for the past week, I will never need MapQuest or Yahoo Maps ever again. It's also so extremely portable that I can store it when parking, travel, etc. The screen is extremely bright and viewable in all light conditions. I thought that the small 3.5" diagonal screen would be too small, but it's just right. The text-to-speech is awesome, accurate, and very understandable. The TTS comes in various languages as well (was brushing up on my French). Satellite reception is excellent, fast on many occasions. There are times when it will say "Poor satellite reception" but I just reboot the system and it picks them up again. With all of the highlights for this awesome gadget, the best feature is the POI. If you want Chinese food, the searchable POI is extremely powerful. Need a local Target? No problem. How about an Apple store. Easy. It's a Yellow Pages for the entire country. I haven't used any of the Travel Tools, but I'm sure they're just as good. Highly recommended.

review_title: Suction cup problem
review_text: Great product and very easy to use; however, be careful about the mount. We use this between our two vehicles, and when we had taken the mount off the windshield, we had to use a putty knife to get it off (apparently the sun had somewhat melted the rubber). Also, if your windshield is cold, it won't stick to it. Solution? I'm not sure. I would guess that you would need two mounts for each vehicle, because once on you don't want to take it off.

review_text: This GPS is incredibly simple, and basic. Yet for you money it is an excellent option. You get the holder and the car plug in. With updated info, this device works almost exactly the same as higher end gps. Only one voice option, comes with an auto dimmer, and can track your speed. You can't play music and your indicator is perpetually an arrow. But most people don't use these to play music and for $100 less than the higher end GPS's I can live with being an arrow on the screen. O.o

review_title: Great unit but rip-offs by Tom Tom
review_text: I am familiar with the Tom Tom One XL, and while it is one of the best GPS units out there today, I would not buy it. The reason is you would think that Tom Tom would at least provide a basic carrying case as part of the standard equipment that comes in the box. In my opinion, a carrying case is essential for a high-tech piece of equipment such as this, even if it is not a fancy case, and you should not be required to spend extra money if you want one.On top of spending hundreds of dollars for the GPS, they try to milk you even more by offering the case as an option you have to buy. What a rip off!Wake up Tom Tom and have a nice long talk with your marketing director!

review_title: Works very well for a navigation, msn direct is overrated
review_text: I got this a couple of months ago and excitedly played around with it to see all it's capabilities. I live just outside Boston, and work even further away from Boston, so I always hit traffic on my way home and got this because it advertised it could warn about traffic and give you alternate routes that avoid heavy traffic. Hasn't happened yet. When I switch to msn direct, it gives me traffic reports in the Boston city itself, 17 miles away, which I'm not interested in, and although I have traffic as an avoidance in my gps settings, it leads me right into the most congested route. So I don't get what the hype is about, besides calling the street names and giving me weather report. I wouldn't renew my msn direct subscription. The navigation itself is very good; it helps out when you get lost and doesn't lose signal as often in the city, which is a plus, with all the tall buildings around. I'd recommend you buy it, just don't expect it to work miracles...

review_title: Garmin nuvi 350 Worked Great for Me!
review_text: I bought a Garmin nuvi 350 especially for a trip to New England, a trip that would take us through three States and many, many small towns and back roads. I'd read about reception issues, so I purchased the external antenna as well.I am glad I bought the external antenna. I believe that made a lot of difference in satellite reception. In terms of accuracy and overall usefulness, I'd rate this unit a full five stars. If we programmed the destination appropriately, the system would get us there reliably.The interface is fairly user-friendly; I was able to use it effectively out of the box without too much difficulty. I do wish there was an in-route screen button for "update me on current location and next turn"-- however, that information is usually visible at the top of the screen, so I can't complain too loud. And when you deliberately depart from a calculated route, it would be nice to have a button that told the system immediately that you had done so consciously, and kick-start a "re-calc."I give the unit fours stars largely because of the lower usefulness of local data. Nearby grocery stores flagged by the nuvi, for example, included a liquor store I wouldn't have entered on a dare! We wandered around Waltham MA following the nuvi's guidance, looking for a full-service market, and finally stopped and asked directions at a gas station.Part of my travel involved finding old pre-Revolutionary War cemeteries, for some of which I had only map coordinates. Being able to plug in these coordinates was invaluable in driving directly and reliably to these locations. And when we found gravestones of interest, we could use the "my current location" feature to get a fairly accurate fix on our ancestor's grave, for future reference (out to five decimal points of a degree).The funniest experience I had was in taking the ferry from Grand Isle County VT westward to Plattsburgh NY. The system got me to the Vermont-side ferry landing and onto the ferry just fine. But a few hundred yards off shore it went crazy, "recalculating" over and over again until I shut it down (well, went back to the main menu). However, when I was a few hundred yards off the NY shore, I restarted the GPS function, and it resumed giving directions like nothing had happened! A similar thing happened on my return later that same day.All-in-all the unit performed as expected. And it was a great convenience for reducing anxiety while driving in completely unfamiliar territory. I'd buy it again.***UPDATE*** [7 July 2009] After updating the GPS data-base (Garmin gives you one free update), I traveled again from Grand Isle VT to Plattsburgh NY. This time the system did not go crazy while over water; the map showed the ferry route, and the GPS performed as though we were on solid highway. Just thought you'd want to know.

review_title: UNBELIEVABLE!!!
review_text: I'm going to just say it: This thing is freaking awesome! I purchased this unit for my wife, as she's been going on about a car navigation system for a couple years now, plus I was sort of out of good Christmas gift ideas. I looked at the feedback on some of the cheaper models and deciced if I was going to get a medium priced unit I'd get the one that was a little more money, but had better reviews. I really didn't know the full capabilities of these things until we fired it up on a trip to the Rockies for a holiday vacation. We didn't read the manual, we just turned it on and played with it. It was very easy to use without instructions, as a matter of fact, we stil haven't read the manual. I was blown away that you can find eateries, hotels, and just about any other landmark besides addresses on this unit. Little hole in the wall, greasy spoon joints, or 5 star restaurants all come up. I couldn't even get away with my usual fast driving as my wife just needed to look on the Magellan to see how fast I was driving. That part I don't like...LOL. I loved the feature that shows how far to your destination, and how many minutes it should take you to get there. I did notice the one part of the manual that I did glance at said something about an external antenna, and I was disappointed that maybe we wouldn't get good performance until we got one of those. I ordered the Gilsson model but it came while we were gone, and now I'm not sure we need it. It was fast enough for me with signal aquisition, with the standard attached antenna. Now all our family members want one of these, and I want one too, for my own car. Perhaps the coolest invention since Tivo.

review_title: High quality GPS, with minor problems
review_text: Have had this C580 for 1 month now, and have generally been happy with it. So far it has always gotten me within sight range of my destination, though the final directional command is sometimes not applicable. After having it for 2 weeks, it did lose my stored favorites. Those are my only complaints.One other comment is that when I read the "What's in the box" list, I did not think that it included a charging cord, so I purchased charging cords (Car and Home) from Gomadic. However, it says the MSN direct receiver has an "integrated vehicle power cable", which charges the unit. I thought the power cable just charged the MSN receiver, but it charges the C580 as well.

review_title: This Unit is Fantastic!!!
review_text: I was surprised how accurate this unit was when I went on a trip from Teaneck, NJ to Jerricho, NY. I also used it on various other trips. The screen is nice and bright. It tells you when to make turns via voice and on screen instructions. For example, it will say "make a right onto Teaneck Road in 3/4 of a mile." Then when you get to the turn, it will say "make a right on Teaneck Road." Some units are advertised that they give voice prompts but be careful. Some only say "make a right in 3/4 of a mile," and then when you get to the turn will not say anything. Some newer units don't even give voice prompts and this is something that really is helpful when on the road. On the screen, a large arrow appears when you need to make turns. It recalculates if you miss a turn. You can update the unit's maps using the included software. There's even a battery meter to show how charged the battery is.

review_title: Garmin GPS products are best!
review_text: This is my second GPS from Garmin StreetPilot series. First one was StreetPilot c550 and now this one C580. I drove down from Michigan to Georgia almost 750m with c580 without any glitch. However, in Atlanta, I had some troubles with c580. It took me to some unknown destinations. I've updated c580 with 2009 maps now and find the issue has reduced little bit. Overall, I'm pleased with the TTS, bluetooth, 6-7 hours battery backup and above all traffic alerts and auto detour calculate feature in c580. Anyday, Garmin makes the best GPS.

review_title: Jill is my pilot
review_text: I got the Garmin 2720 because I'm forever getting lost. I decided to spend more money on this particular model because it actually gives the street names versus just saying 'turn right' or 'turn left'. I've been very pleased by Jill, which is the name for the voice w/the American accent. I've used her for up the eastern seaboard and locally, and she hasn't let me down. The only thing that may be lacking is thay you only get one choice for a route. It's my understanding that other systems give you several options. So... if I don't like the route that Jill chooses for me, I'm out of luck. The thing is, that she's never steered me wrong! I recommend the 2720.

review_title: Glad I settled on this one
review_text: This is my first GPS and I've only had it for about a month. The only comparison I have is using the GPS in my mom's jaguar - didn't like it. First, the only two lows for the Navigon: battery life is short - if your trip is more than two hours, just hook up the power chord at the get-go. (Very difficult to do while you're driving, as I learned.) Also, you have to charge it first thing out of the box. Low #2: the windshield mount (which looks very sleek) is long, which gets the unit close to you but allows it to shake around way too much. It hasn't come loose but it looks like it might. I'm considering one of those sand-bag dash mounts. I do drive a convertible, which are known for cowl shake and I have the unit mounted near the left corner near the A-pillar, to the left of the steering wheel, so those may contribute to the shake. Your shake may vary.Pros: where do I start? The traffic data (FREE!) is great! I don't have a long commute anymore so it took a while for me to have an incident in my route. The rerouting around the traffic event was great. Later, on that same drive, it rerouted again for traffic and told me what it was doing. Because of the traffic info, I use GPS even when I know where I'm going. Speaking of that: when you know where you're going and you take a different turn from the GPS route, it is very quick to recalculate (seconds). It will try to get you back on the original route (sometimes several tries) but when it sees that you aren't going to, it quickly recalculates. (Oh, okay, I see what you're doing.)The lane feature is great. The reality view of the signage is not all that important to me but the orange lane arrows on the picture of the highway are great. Also, when you come up to an interchange and your route is to keep going straight, She tells you to keep left and the reality view pops up and shows orange arrows going straight in all the lanes that are going straight. It's not critical for me to know I'm going straight through since that has already been established but the lane arrows are very handy in those situations.You can set it up to warn you when you're over the speed limit. I set it for 15 over. This is very handy when you are on highways in the city and can't use cruise control. When you get a little too exuberant, she just says "caution" and a little caution sign appears next to the speed limit display. Very nice!I have found the destination announcements to be very accurate. Plus, she tells you which side of the street it's on - I never can remember that address rule.I haven't used the Bluetooth connection to my phone yet - nothing to report there.The only time I used the Zagat POI info was when I wanted to find out the prices at a pricey restaurant. The restaurant's web site wouldn't tell me. However, finding the nearest (non-Zagat reviewed) restaurants has really been helpful.Telling you the street and highway names is great. Less time looking at the GPS rather than the road is better IMO. Sometimes the pronunciation is off. Kinda like someone from out-of-town would do.The larger screen is a must for me. I use 2.00 diopter reading glasses and most of what I need, I can see on the unit without my glasses. Some stuff is small, e.g. estimated time of arrival, and requires my glasses but with the voice and the orange lane arrows I'm generally good-to-go.I highly recommend the Navigon 7100. I'm almost to the point where it is a necessity. What better thing for a man - we don't have to stop & ask for directions anymore - right, like we ever did that.

review_title: Pretty good little machine
review_text: I got this little guy because I recently moved to Seattle and found that Mapquest and Google maps were getting me lost more often than my work was willing to tolerate. So far, it's been a pretty good machine. It hasn't gotten me to the wrong place yet, but it has occasionally tried to send me the wrong way down a one way street. If I keep on going in a different direction, it usually adjusts for me, and only once has it been stubborn enough to keep trying to get me to go somewhere I couldn't go. All in all I'd recommend it. As far as the MSN stuff goes, I haven't had much success with that, so I don't know if I'd recommend that. It keeps telling me that it could take several minutes--the problem is several minutes can end up being hours.

review_title: Made travelling for two weeks in Germany a breeze
review_text: My wife and I used the 350 and the Germany/Czech Republic mapset during our two week vacation in Germany. Finding some of the locations we went to via a map or directions would have been much much more difficult.There were times it told me that the location was on the left when it was actually on the right, and vice versa. Also, once or twice it did get a little turned around when close to the location, but that was taken care of by drivig around the block and looking again.Once the unit hung, and I had to perform a hard reset, and sometimes it takes a little more than a minute to get a lock on the satellites.But this little beauty really made our driving much more enjoyable. Just kick back, and let it tell you when you need to turn.Very good product.

review_title: GPS works well, holder is a joke
review_text: This is my first GPS unit and I have really enjoyed having it. I really like the lane assist. I find it to be accurate. Its directions are 98% of the time the route I would have taken. 2% takes me on a scenic drive that I don't really understand why it thinks is faster. It functions great and is quick enough that I don't feel like I wait on it. My biggest complaint is the holder to attach the unit to the windshield. I read the reviews about it being loose and really tried to be careful with it. It became so loose in 4 months that I had to call and get a new one. They sent me a shipping label to return it and got a new one in under a week. Driving down the street the new holder just snapped and the GPS unit went flying to the ground. They can't seem to build a quality holder. I am looking into other options since it cost enough that throwing it away and starting over isn't an option.

review_title: Do NOT Buy This One---Buy The C530 Instead
review_text: The Garmin C330 is "a good product." BUT, it is currently NOT "state of the art". For almost the same price you can get the Garmin C530. The C530 has a brighter screen. And, just as important, the C530 has a "Sirf" receiver. With the "Sirf" receiver I could "acquire sattlites" even inside my house---where before with an i3 I could not. And, I shopped around finding several places that sell the C530 for about $465. If you send me an email, if Amazon will allow it, I'll tell you where I found this lower price! Email:boland7214@aol.PS: Yes, it's true the C530 does NOT have "voice recognition" announcing the upcoming street name. But, do you really need it? I don't miss voice recognition because the SAME INFORMATION is PRINTED on TOP of the C530 screen in BIG LETTERS. If you can read you WILL know what is the next street---you HAVE to look at the GPS anyway to see where to turn...so just READ the next street. It's "no problem" in my opinion.Afterword: Stop! My C530 just died---won't start. I'll let you know more about what happens later.

review_title: Fantastic!
review_text: I researched GPS systems for weeks trying to find the "perfect" one for my husband for Christmas. I insisted it be a wide screen and announced the street names. At first I wanted a Garmin because that is what everyone was telling me to get. But theirs with that criteria were beyond my budget. A friend recommended this model and decided to go for it.Wow, he was not disappointed. After a few months of my husband using it, he says it is the best gift I have given him in 20 years of marriage. He travels anywhere from Boston to Florida for work. If he's driving its in his car. If he flies, he takes it along and used it in rental cars. He says it works absolutely amazingly. He is very impressed with its performance and features. After years of trying to quickly get out of the parking lot at Newark airport, this gps showed him a route that no signs there shows and he was out and on the highway so quickly he was totally amazed the gps found this route. Everytime he does it, he still comments on it. Says it was worth every penney JUST for that. lolI have never been motivated to write a review before. But we are beyond happy with this model that I just had to make sure to help others with their research. So we highly recommend this unit and all its wonderful features.

review_title: Garmin is the leader in GPS Units for a reason
review_text: I had the original Garmin unit (a PDA with the GPS built in) where you had to install the maps for the regions you needed [back when storage space/ memory cards were expensive!) and boy have they come a long way.When I purchased the Nuvi in 2008 It was obviously an improvement as all of the maps for North America were already loaded.[Now they even come with auto updates of the maps for life which is huge! as nobody ever updated their maps due to the cost of doing so).I am now on my 4th Garmin and have bought them for family and friends.....I dont know how we got by with maps and mapquest alone prior to GPS units in the cars.

review_title: Awesome GPS system!!
review_text: I got this Garmin Nuvi 350 for Christmas, and have tested it on several trips. Works great, very accurate, quick to "recalculate" when you miss a turn, and gives you a nice verbal warning shortly before every turn to make sure you stay on the right track. Also, it is fun to check out the points of interest-- lots of places listed, so if you need to find a place to eat (or whatever), the Nuvi is quick to help you out!

review_title: Should be a little cheaper I think
review_text: I'm a little disappointed in it. It is an accurate leader but does not really chose the fastest way. Sometimes it leads you into one way streets where traffic goes totally the opposite direction. Also once when I was in a neighborgood im not familiar with I searched for a gas station but it took me to a restaurant. Otherwise, when you type in the address or an intersection it takes you to the exact place. I don't know, maybe it works better in smaller towns/cities. (I'm from New York City where traffic directions might get changed from time to time.)
